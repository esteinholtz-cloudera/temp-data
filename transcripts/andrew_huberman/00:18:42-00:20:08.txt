  "Text": "interesting, you should say that I never considered myself claustrophobic but um because I don't mind small environments provided they're well ventilated. I uh before COVID, I started going to this Russian Banya. Um you know, and I, and I had never been to a Banya. So, you know, the whole experience of really, really hot sauna and uh what do they call it? The plots they're hitting you with the leaves and the, and it gets really hot and humid in there. And there were a couple of times where I thought, OK, this thing is below ground. in a city where there are a lot of earthquakes, like if this place crumbled and we were stuck in here and I'd start getting a little panicky and I realized I'm like, I don't like small confined spaces with poor ventilation. So I realized, I think I have some claustrophobia and I wasn't aware of that before. So I put myself into our own claustrophobia stimulus which involves getting into an elevator. And with a bunch of people, virtual people and the elevator gets stalled and at first you're fine, you feel fine. But then as we start modulating the environment and we actually can control levels of oxygen in the environment if we want to. Um, it is really uncomfortable for me. And I never would have thought, you know, I fly, I'm comfortable in planes. I, but it is really uncomfortable. And so I think I've un unhatched a bit of a claustrophobia. Yeah."
