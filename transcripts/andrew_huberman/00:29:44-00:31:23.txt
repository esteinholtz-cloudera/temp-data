  "Text": "there's some slicing of time that happens and then you're, you're able to adjust slice time more finely, a more finally, in order to adjust to the the stimulus, the dynamics of the stimulus, what about the, realm of ideas? So like, know, I'm a big believer, there's a guy named Cal Newport who wrote a book about deep work. I love that. Yeah, he's great. he um I mean, one of the nice things I've always practiced deep work but he, it's, it's always nice to have words put to the concepts that you've practiced, it somehow makes them more concrete and allows you to uh to get better. It turns it into a skill that you can get better at. But, you know, I also value deep thinking you think it's almost meditative. You think about a particular concept for long periods of time, the programming, you have to do that kind of thing for you just have to hold this concept like, like you hold it and then you take steps with it, you take further steps and you're holding relatively complicated things in your mind as you're thinking about them. And there's a lot of, mean, the hardest part is there's a frustrating things like you take a step and it turns out to be the wrong direction. You have to calmly turn around and take a step back and then you're kind of like exploring through the space of ideas. Is there something about your study of optimal performance that could be applied to the act of thinking as opposed to action?"
