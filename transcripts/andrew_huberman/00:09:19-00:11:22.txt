  "Text": "video and this was important to us, right? So when we decided to set up this platform, a lot of the motivation was that a lot of the studies of, these things in laboratories, I don't want to call them lame because I want to be respectful of the, the people that did this stuff before. But they'd study fear by, you know, showing subjects a picture of a bloody arm or a snake or something like that or, and it just unless you have a snake phobia, it just wasn't creating a real enough experience. So we need to do something where people aren't going to get injured, but where we can tap into the physiology and that thing of presence of people, momentarily, not the whole time, but momentarily getting there in a laboratory. And so heights will always do it. And I if people want to challenge me on this, I I like to point to that movie Free Solo, which was wild because, you know, it's an incredible movie. But I think a lot of its popularity can be explained a puzzle which is you knew he was gonna live when you walked in the theater or you watched it on, at home, you knew before that he's, he survived. And yet it was still scary that people somehow were able to put themselves into that experience or into Alex's experience enough that they, they were concerned or worried or afraid at some level. So heights always does it. we get people who have generalized anxiety, these are people who wa wake up and move through life at a generally higher state of autonomic arousal and anxiety, then we can tip them a little bit more easily with things that don't necessarily get everyone afraid. Things like um claustrophobia, public speaking, gonna vary from person to person. Um And then if you're afraid of sharks, like my sister, friends is afraid of sharks, she won't even come to my laboratory because there's, there's a thing about sharks in it. That's how terrified some people are of these specific stimuli, but heights gets them every time and I'm terrified of heights. It it's, you know, when we have you step off a platform, virtual platform and it's a flat floor in my lab. we, you're up there where"
