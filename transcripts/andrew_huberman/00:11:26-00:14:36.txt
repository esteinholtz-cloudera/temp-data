  "Text": ", maybe I should describe a little bit of the experiment. So um without giving away too much in case someone wants to be a subject in one of these uh experiments we have them playing a cognitive game. It's a simple lights out kind of game where you're, you know, pointing a cursor and turning out lights on a grid, but it gets increasingly complex and it speeds up on them. And um you know, there's a failure point for everybody where they just can't make the motor commands fast enough. then we surprise people essentially by placing them virtually all of a sudden they're, they're on a narrow platform between two buildings and then we encourage them or we cue them with a, with a by talking to them through a microphone to continue across that platform to continue the game. you know, some people they, they just won't, they actually will hold, get down on the ground and hold on to a virtual beam that doesn't even exist on a flat floor. And so what this really tells us is the power of the brain to enter these states as if they were real. And we really think that anchoring the visual and the vestibular, the balance components of the nervous system are what bring people into that presence so quickly. There's also the potential and we haven't done this yet to bring in 360 sound. the reason we did 360 video is that when we started all this back in 2016, a lot of the VR was pretty lame. Frankly, it was CG I, it just wasn't real enough. But with 360 video. We knew that we could get people into this presence where they think they're in a real experience more quickly. And our friend Michael Muller, who has to because of the project, I reached out to some friends, Michael Muller is a very famous um portrait photographer in Hollywood, but he dives with great white sharks and he leaves the cage. And so we worked with him to build a 360 video apparatus that we could swim under water with went out to Guadalupe Island, Mexico and got the experience. It was a lot of fun. It was uh there was some interesting moments out there of danger, but it came back with that video and built that for the sharks. And then we realized we need to do this for everything, we need to do it for heights. We need to do it for public speaking, for claustrophobia. And what's missing still is 360 sound where 360 sound would be. Uh for instance, um if I were to turn around and there was a like a giant attack dog there, the moment I would turn around and see it, the dog would growl. But if I turned back toward you, then it would, it would be silent., and that brings a very real element to one's own behavior where you don't know what's going to happen if you turn a corner. Whereas if there's a dog growling behind me and I'm, and I turn around and then I turn back to you and it's still growling that might seem like more of an impending threat but, um, unsustained threat. But actually, it's when you start linking your own body movements to the experience. So when it's closed loop my movements and choices are starting to influence things and they're getting scarier and scarier. That's when you can really drive people's nervous system down these paths of high, high states of stress and fear. Now, we don't want to traumatize people obviously. But we also we also study a number of tools to that allow them to calm themselves in these environments. So the short answer is heights. He, yeah."
