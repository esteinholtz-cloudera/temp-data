We also have a spider stimulus but like snakes, I just don't like them. There's something about the, the slithering and it just, it creates a visceral response for me. Um Some people not so much and they have lower levels of stress and fear in there. But one way that we can get them feel more of that is to use mixed reality where we have a, an actual physical bat they have to stomp out the snake as opposed to just um walk to a little safe corner which then makes the snake disappear. That tends to be not as stressful as if they have a physical weapon. And so you got people in there, you know, banging on the floor against this thing and there's something about engaging that makes it more of a, more of a threat. Now, I should also mention we, we always get the subjective report from the subject of what they experience because, we never want to project our own ideas about what they were feeling. But that's the beauty of working with humans is you can ask them how they feel and humans aren't great at explaining how they feel. Um But it's a lot easier to understand what they're saying than a mouse or a macaque monkey is saying. So it's the best we can do is language plus these physiological and neurophysiological"
