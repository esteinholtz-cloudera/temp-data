  "Text": ". And that comes from two, from a, you know, research study standpoint, uh two parallel tracks of research. One was done actually in mice. Uh because we have a mouse lab also where we can probe around different brain areas and try and figure out what interesting brain areas we might want to probe around in humans. And graduate student in my lab. She's now at Caltech um Lindsay. So um published a paper back in 2018 showing that at what at first might seem a little bit but the mechanisms are not, which is that there are really three responses to fear. You can pause, you can freeze, essentially. Um you can retreat, you can back up or you can go forward there's a single hub of neurons in the midbrain. In the, it's actually not the midbrain, but it's, it's in the middle of the thalamus, which is a four brain structure. And depending on which neurons are active, there, there's a much higher probability that a mouse or it turns out or a human will advance in the face of fear or will pause or will, will retreat. Now that just assigns a neural structure to a behavioral phenomenon. But what's interesting is that it turns out that the lowest level of stress or autonomic arousal is actually associated with the pausing and freezing response as the threat becomes more impending and we used visual looms. In this case, retreat response has a slightly higher level of autonomic arousal and stress. So think about playing hide and go seeking. You're trying to stay quiet in a uh in a closet that you're hiding. If you're very calm, it's easy to stay quiet and still. As your level of stress goes up, it's harder to maintain that level of quiet and stillness. see this also in animals that are stalking, a cat will chatter its teeth that's actually sort of top down inhibition and trying to restrain behavior. So the freeze response is actually an active response, but it's fairly low stress. And what was interesting to us is that the highest level of autonomic arousal was associated with the forward movement toward the threat. So, in your case, um jumping out of the plane, however, the forward movement in the face of threat linked to the activation of what we call collateral, which means just a side connection, literally a wire in the brain that connects to the dopamine circuits for reward. And so when one safely and adaptively, meaning you survive moves through a threat or toward a threat, it's rewarded as a positive experience. And so the key, it actually maps very well. The cognitive behavioral therapy and a lot of the existing treatments for trauma is that you have to confront thing that makes you afraid. So otherwise you exist in this very low level of reverb toy circuit activity where the the circuits for autonomic arousal are humming and they're humming more and more and more. And we have to remember that that stress and fear and threat were designed to agitate us so that we actually move that. So the reason I mentioned this is, I think a lot of times people think that maximum, you know, stress response or fear response is to freeze and to lock up, but that's actually not the maximum stress response, the maximum stress response is to advance, but it's associated with reward, it has positive valence. So, so there's this kind of, everyone always thinks about the bell, you know, the sort of hump shaped curve, you know, at low levels of arousal performance is low and as it increases, performance goes higher and then it drops off as you get really stressed. But there's another bump further out the distribution where you perform very well under very high levels of stress. And so we've been spending a lot of time in humans and in animals exploring what it takes to get people comfortable to go to that place and also to let them experience how there are heightened states of cognition. There, um changes in time perception that allow you to evaluate your environment in fast at a faster frame rate. Essentially, this is the matrix as a lot of people think of it. Um But we tend to think about fear as all the low level stuff where things aren't worked out. But there are many um there are a lot of different features to the fear response. And so we think about it quantitatively and we think about it from a circuit perspective in terms of outcomes we try and weigh that against the threat. So we never want people to put themselves in unnecessary risk. But that's where the VR is fun because you can push people hard without risk of physically or injuring them."
