  "Text": "do because let's say I had an ability to place a chip anywhere I wanted in the brain today and activate it or inhibit that area. I'm not sure I would put that chip in Neocortex except maybe to just kind of have some fun and see what happens. reason is it's an abstraction machine. And especially if I wanted to make a mass production tool, a tool in mass production that I could give to a lot of people because it's quite possible that your abstractions are different enough than mine that I wouldn't know what patterns of firing to induce. But if I want, let's say I want to increase my level of focus and creativity. Well, then I would love to be able to, for instance, my level of limbic friction. I would love to be able to wake up and go. Oh, you know what? I have an eight o'clock appointment, I wake up slowly. So between seven and eight, but I want to do a lot of linear thinking. So you know what I'm gonna just, I'm gonna turn down the limbic friction and ramp up prefrontal cortex activation. So there's a lot of stuff that can happen in the thalamus with sensory gating. Um For instance, you could shut down that shell around the thalamus and allow more creative thinking by allowing more lateral connections. These would be some of the, those would be the experiments I'd want to do. So. They're in the subcortical quote unquote monkey brain. But you could then look at what sorts of abstract thoughts and behaviors would arise from that than, and, and here, I'm not pointing the finger at neuralink at all. But there's this obsession with Neocortex, but I, I'm gonna, well, I might lose a few friends but I'll hopefully gain a few. And, and also um one of the reasons people spend so much time in Neocortex., I have a fact and an opinion, one fact is that you can image there and you can record there. Right now. The two photon and one photon microscopy methods that allow you to image deep into the brain still don't allow you to image down really deep unless you're jamming prisms in there and endoscopes and then in the endoscopes are very narrow. So you're getting very, know, it's like looking at the bottom of the ocean through a, through a spotlight. And so you much easier to look at the waves up on top, right? So let's face it folks, a lot of the reasons why there's so many recordings in layer 23 of cortex with all this advanced microscopy is because it's very hard to image deeper. Now, the microscopes are getting better. And thanks to the amazing work mainly of engineers and chemists and physicists. Let's face it. They're the ones who brought this revolution to neuroscience in the last 10 years or so, you can image deeper, but don't really, why you see so many reports on layer 23. The other thing which is purely opinion and I'm not going after anybody here. But is that as long as there's no clear right answer, it becomes a little easier to do creative work in a structure where no one really knows how it works. So it's fun to probe around because anything you see is novel, if you're gonna work in the thalamus or the pulvinar or the hypothalamus or these structures that have been known about since the sixties and seventies. And really, since the, you know, centuries ago, are dealing with exist, you have to combat existing models And when razzing cortex, no one knows how the thing works. The Neocortex six layer cortex. And so so everything is room for discovery. There's a lot more room for discovery and I'm not calling anyone out. I love cortex. We've published some papers on cortex. It's super interesting. But I, I think with the tools that are available nowadays where people are trying ahead of, of not just reading from the brain monitoring activity, but writing to the brain, I think we really have to be careful and we need to be thoughtful about what are we trying to write? What script are we trying to write? Because there are many brain structures for which we already know what scripts they write. And I think there's tremendous value there. I don't think it's boring. fact that they act like machines makes them predictable. Those are your zeros and ones let's start there. But let what they're what's sort of happening in this field of writing to the brain is there's this idea And again, I want to be clear, I'm not pointing at neuralink. I'm mainly pointing at the, the neocortical jockeys out there that go and you observe patterns and then you think replaying those patterns is going to give rise to something interesting. I I should call out one experiment or two experiments which were done by Susumu to Nagawa Nobel Prize winner from MIT done important work in memory and immunology. Of course is where he got his Nobel as well as Mark May Ford's lab at UC San Diego. They did an experiment where they monitored a bunch of neurons while an animal learned something, then they captured those neurons through some molecular tricks they could replay the neurons. So now there's like perfect case scenario. It's like OK, you monitor the neurons in your brain. Then I say, OK, neurons one through 100 were played in the particular sequence. So you know the space time, you know the keys on the piano that were played that gave rise to the song, which was the behavior and then you go back and you reactivate those neurons except you reactivate them all at once, like slamming on all the keys once on the piano and you get the exact same behavior. the space time code be meaningless for some structures. Now, that's freaky, that's a scary thing because what that means is that all the space time firing in cortex, space part may matter more than the time part. So, you know, rate codes and spacetime codes, we don't know. And, you know, I'd rather have, I'd rather deliver more answers in this discussion than questions. But I think it's an important consideration."
