  "Text": ". And that's primarily facing time by the visual system in humans. We don't walk through space. For instance, like a cent hound would look at three dimensional scent plumes. You know, when a scent hound goes out in the environment, they have depth to their odor, the odor trails they're following and they don't think about them. If we don't think about odor trails, you might say, oh well, the smell is getting more intense aha but they actually have three dimensional odor trails. So they see a cone of odor, see of course, with their nose, with their olfactory cortex, we do that with our visual system and we parse time often subconsciously mainly with our visual system also with our auditory system. And this shows up for the musicians out there. Metronomes are a great way to play with this. Um you know, bass drumming, when the frequency of bass drumming changes your perception of time changes quite a lot. So in any event, space and time are linked in the through the sensory apparat i through the eyes and ears and nose and probably through taste too and through touch um for us, but mainly through vision. So when you drop into some coding or iterating through a creative process or trying to solve something hard, can't really do that. Well, if you're in a rigid um high level of autonomic arousal, because you're plugging in algorithms that are in this space regime, this time regime matches it's space time matched. Whereas creativity, I always think the lava lamp is actually a pretty good example, even though it has these counterculture new A G connotations because you actually don't know which direction things are gonna change. And so in drowsy states, and drowsy states, space and time become dislodged from one another somewhat and they're very fluid. And I think that's why a lot of solutions come to people after sleep and naps. And this could even take us into a discussion if you like about psychedelics. And what we now know, for instance that people thought that psychedelics work by just creating spontaneous bursting of neurons and hallucinations. the, the five H two C A and two C and two A receptors, which are the main sites for things like LSD and psilocybin and some of the other um hall the ones that create hallucinations, the drugs that create hallucinations. The most of those receptors are actually in the um collection of neurons that encase the thalamus, which is where all the sensory information goes into a structure called the thalamic reticular nucleus. Um it's an inhibitory structure that makes sure that when we're sitting here talking that I'm mainly focused on whatever I'm seeing visually, that I'm essentially eliminating a lot of sensory information under conditions where people take psychedelics and these uh particular serotonin receptors are activated that inhibitory shell, it's literally shaped like a shell starts losing its ability to inhibit the passage of sensory information. But mostly effects of psychedelics are because the lateral connectivity in layer five of cortex across cortical areas is increased. And what that does is that means that the spacetime relationship for vision like moving my finger from here to here, very rigid spacetime relationship, right? If I slow it down, it's slower, obviously. But there's a prediction that can be made based on the neurons in the retina and the cortex on psychedelics. This could be very strange experience, but the auditory system has one that's slightly different time and they're matched to one another in deeper circuits in the brain. The olfactory system has a different space time relationship to it. So conditions of of these increased activation of these serotonin receptors, space and time across sensory area starts being fluid. So I'm no longer running the algorithm for moving my finger from here to here and making a prediction based on vision alone. now this is where people talk about um hearing sites, right? You start linking the, this might actually make a sound in a psychedelic state. Now, I'm not suggesting people run out and do psychedelics because it's very disorganized, but essentially what you're doing is you're mixing the algorithms. And so when you talk about being able to access new solutions, you don't need to rely on psychedelics. If people choose to do that, that's their business. But in drowsy states, lateral connectivity is increased as well. The shell of the thalamus shuts down. And what's ha these are through these so called ponds chic occipital waves. And what's happening is you're getting whole brain activation at a level that you start mixing algorithms. And so sometimes I think solutions come not from being in that narrow tunnel of space time and strong activation of working memory and trying to well iterate. If this then that's very strong deductive and inductive thinking working from first principles, but also from states where something that was a an algorithm that never you never had in existence before suddenly gets lumped with another algorithm. And all of a sudden a new possibility comes to mind. And so and time need to be fluid and space and time need to be rigid in order to come up with something meaningful. And I realize I'm riffing long on this, but this is why I think, you know, there was so much interest a few years ago with Michael Pollen's book and, and other things happening about psychedelics as a pathway to exploration and all this kind of thing. But the real question is what you export back from those experiences because dreams are amazing. But if you can't bring anything back from them, they're just amazing. I"
