  "Text": "there are other forms of intelligence. I mean, I think what humans are really good at. Um And here I want to be clear that this is not a formal model, but what humans are really good at is taking that um plasma barbell that we were talking about earlier and not just using it for analysis of space like the media environment, but also using historical information. Like I can read a book today about the history of medicine. I happen to be doing that lately for some stuff I'm researching and I can take that information and if I want, I can inject it into my plans for the future. Other animals don't seem to do that over the same time scales that we do. It may be that the chipmunks are all hiding little like notebooks everywhere in the form of like little dirt castles or something that we don't understand. I mean, the waggle dance of the bee is in the most famous example, bees come back to the hive, they orient relative to the honeycomb and they waggle. There's a guy down in Australia named Srinivasan who studied this and it's really interesting. No one really understands it except he understands it best. bee waggles at a in a couple ways relative to the orientation of the honeycomb. And then all the other bees see that it's visual and they go out and they know the exact coordinate system to get to the, to the source of whatever it was the food and bring it back. And he's done it where they isolate the bees. He's changed the visual flight environment, all this stuff, they are communicating and they're communicating something about something they saw recently, but it doesn't extend over very long periods of time, same way that you and I can both read a book or you can recommend something to me and then we could converge on a set of ideas later. And, uh, in fairness because she was the one that said it and I didn't, and I hadn't even thought of it., when you talked to Lisa on your podcast, she brought up something beautiful, which is that I never really occurred to me and I was sort of embarrassed that it hadn't, but it's really beautiful and brilliant, which is that, you know, we don't just encode senses in the form of like color and light and sound waves and taste. But ideas become a form of sensory mapping. that's where the cool, you know, the really, really cool and exciting stuff is. But we just don't understand what the receptive fields are for ideas. What's an idea of receptive field"
