  "Text": "I have to, you know, I confess ignorance when it comes to, you know, most things about coding and I have some quantitative ability, but I don't have strong quantitative leanings. And so, I know my limitations too. And so I, I think the next generation coming up, you know, a lot of the students at Stanford are really interested in quantitative models and theory. And A I, and I remember when I was coming up, a lot of the people who are doing work ahead of me, I kind of rolled my eyes at some of the stuff they were doing um including some of their personalities, although I have many great um senior colleagues in the world. So it's the way of the world. So nobody knows what it's like to be a, you know, a young graduate student in 2020 except the young graduate student. So I, I know what I do. I I know there are a lot of things I don't know. um in addition to why do a lot of public education increase scientific literacy and neuroscientific thinking, et cetera. A big goal of mine is to try and at least pave the way so that these really brilliant and forward thinking um younger scientists can make the biggest possible dent and make what will eventually be all us old guys and gals look stupid. I mean, that's, that's what we were all trying to do. That's what we were trying to do. So, yeah."
