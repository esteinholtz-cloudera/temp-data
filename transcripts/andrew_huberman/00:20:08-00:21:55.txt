  "Text": ", for me as well. Probably that one, that one is pretty bad. The heights I tried to overcome. So I went skydiving to try to overcome the fear of heights. Well, that didn't help. Did you jump out, jump out? But it was, it was fundamentally different experience than guess there could be a lot of different flavors of your heights maybe. But the one I have didn't seem to be connected to jumping out of a plane is a very different because once you accept that you're going to jump, it's, it's a different thing. I, I think what I'm afraid of the moments before it is the scariest part. And I don't think that's emphasized in the skydiving experience as much. And also just the acceptance of the fact that it's going to happen. So once you accept that it's going to happen, it's not as scary. It's the fact that it's not supposed to happen and it might, that's the scary part. I guess I'm not being eloquent in his description, but there's something about skydiving uh was actually philosophically liberating. I was, it was, I was like, wow, it, it was uh the possibility that you can walk on a surface and then at a certain point, there's no surface anymore to walk on. And it's all of a sudden, the world becomes three dimensional and there's this freedom of floating that the concept of like earth disappears for a brief few seconds. I don't know that that was, that was wild, but I'm still terrified of heights. So, I mean, one thing I want to ask just unfair because it's so fascinating is, you um learned anything about what it takes to overcome fears?"
