  "Text": "of the great challenges in assigning a good, you know, giving a good answer to the question of like, what's the meaning of life is? Um I think illustrated best by the Victor Frankl example, although there are other examples too, which is that our sense of meaning is very elastic in time and space. And I'm, I'm uh we talked a little bit about this earlier, but amazing to me that somebody locked in a cell or a concentration camp can bring the horizon in close enough that they can then micro slice their environment so that they can find rewards and meaning and power and beauty even in a little square box or, or a horrible situation. I think this is really speaks to one of the most important features of the human mind, which is we could do let's take two opposite extremes. One would be, let's say the alarm went off right now in this building and the building started shaking our vision. Our hearing, everything would be tuned to this space time bubble for those moments everything that we would process all that would matter. The only meaning would be get out of here safe, figure out what's going on, contact loved ones, et cetera. we were to sit back, totally relaxed. We could do the, you know, I think it's called pale blue dot Thing or whatever where we could imagine ourselves in this room and then they were in the United States and this continent and the earth and then peering down at us and all of a sudden you get back, it can seem so big that all of a sudden it's meaningless. Right? If you see yourself as just one brief glimmer in all of time and all of space you go to, I don't matter. And if you go to every little thing that happens in this text thread or this, you know, comment section on youtube or Instagram, your space time bubble is tiny, then everything seems inflated and the brain will contract and dilate its space time, vision and time, but also sense of meaning and that's beautiful and it's what allows us to be so dynamic in different environments and we can pull from the past and the present and future. That's why examples like Nelson Mandela and Victor Frankl had to include it makes sense that it wasn't just about grinding it out. They had to find those dopamine rewards even in those little boxes they were forced into. not trying to dodge an answer. But for me personally, and I think about this a lot because I have this um history in science where my undergraduate, graduate advisor and postdoctoral advisor all died young. So uh you know, and they were wonderful people and had immense importance in my life. But what I realized is that we can get so fixated on the thing that we're experiencing, holding tremendous meaning. But it only holds that meaning for as long as we're in that space time regime. this is important because what really gives meaning is the understanding that you can move between these different space time dimensionality. And I'm not trying to sound like a theoretical physicist or uh anyone that thinks about the cosmos in saying that it's really the fact that we'd say and do and think things and it feels so important. And then two days later, we're like, oh what, what happened? Well, you had a different brain processing algorithm entirely. You were in a completely different state. And so what I want to do in this lifetime is I want to, want to engage in as many different levels of contraction and dilation of meaning as possible. I want to go to the micro, I sometimes think about this. I'm like, if I just pulled over the side of the road, I bet you there's an ant hill there and their whole world is fascinating. You can't stay there you also can't stay staring up at the clouds and just think about how we're just these little beings and it doesn't matter. The key is the journey back and forth, up and down that staircase back and forth and back and forth. And my goal is to get as many trips up and down that stair staircase as I can before the reaper comes for me. Oh, beautiful."
