  "Text": ". Absolutely. And I think what I really appreciate, appreciate about what you're saying is that, whether or not they're working on a kind of a low level synapse that's like a reflex in the musculature or something very high level abstract can benefit from looking at those who prefer three, you know, everyone's going after a 3 m 10 m and 100 m targets in some sense. But to be able to tolerate the discomfort of being in a conversation where there are real answers where the zeros and ones are are known zeros and ones are those the equivalent of that in the in the nervous system. also, as you said, for the people that are very much like, oh, I can only trust what I can see and touch those people need to put themselves into the discomfort of the high level conversation because what's missing is and conceptualization of things at multiple levels. I think one of the this is um I, I don't gripe about my lab's been fortunate, we've been funded from the start and we've been happy um in that, in that regard and lucky and we're grateful for that. But I think one of the challenges of research being so expensive is that there isn't a a lot of time, especially nowadays for people to just convene around a topic there's so much emphasis on productivity. And so there they are actually believe it or not, there aren't that many concepts, formal concepts in neuroscience right now, the last 10 years has been this huge influx of tools. And so people have been neural circuits and probe and around and connectomes. It's been wonderful. But, you know, 1020 years ago when the consciousness stuff was more prominent, the C word, as you said, um, what was good about that time is that people would go to meetings and actually discuss ideas and models. Now, it's sort of like. It's sort of like demonstration day at the school science Fair where everyone's got their thing and some stuff is cooler than others. But, um I think we're gonna see a shift. I'm grateful that we have so many computer scientists and theoreticians and, um, or theorists, I think they call themselves. Um, somebody tell me what the difference is someday. Um, you know, psychology and even dare I say, philosophy, you know, these things are starting to converge we, you know, neuroscience that the name neuroscience, there wasn't even such a thing when I started graduate school or as a postdoc, it was neurophysiology or you were a neur anatomist or what now it's sort of everybody's invited and that's beautiful. That means that something's useful is going to come of all this. there's also tremendous work of course happening on it for the treatment of disease. And we shouldn't overlook that. That's where, you know, ending, you know, eliminating reducing suffering is also a huge initiative of neuroscience. So there's a lot of beauty in the field, but the consciousness thing continues to be a uh it's like an exotic bird. It's like no one really quite knows how to handle it and it dies very easily."
