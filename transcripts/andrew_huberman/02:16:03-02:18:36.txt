  "Text": ". So there's a um we can uh put something very concrete to that. So there's a paper published and sell, you know, super top tier journal uh two years ago. Um looking at effort this was in a visual environment of trying to swim forward toward a target and a reward. And it was a really cool experiment because they manipulated uh virtually the visual environment. So um the same amount of effort was being expended every time. But sometimes the perception was you're making forward progress and sometimes the perception was you're making no progress because stuff wasn't drifting by meant no progress. So you could be swimming and swimming and not making progress. And it turns out that with each bout of effort, a epinephrine and norepinephrine is being released in the brain stem and glia these what traditionally were thought of as support cells for the neurons, but they do a lot of things actively too are measuring the amount of epinephrine and norepinephrine in that circuit. And when it exceeds a certain threshold, the glia send inhibitory signals that shut down, top down control, they literally, it's the, you quit, you stop, there's no no more. It's you quit enduring, can be rescued. Endurance can be rescued with dopamine. be. So that's where the subjective part really comes into play. So you quit because um you've learned how to turn that off or you've learned how to, some people will reward the pain process so much that friction becomes the reward. And I, you know, when you talk about people like Goggins and other people, I know from special operations and people have gone through treatments three times. You hear about, you know, just when you hear about people, the Victor Frankl stories. I mean, you hear about Nelson Mandela, you hear about these stories, I'm sure the same process is involved. Again, this speaks to the generalisability of these processes as opposed to a neural circuit for a particular action or cognitive function. So I think um you have to learn to subjectively self reward in a way that replenishes you. Uh Goggins talks about eating souls. It's a very dramatic example his mind. Apparently that's a form of reward, but it's not just a form of reward where you're, it's like a, you're picking up a trophy or something. It's, it's actually it gives the energy. It's a reward that gives more neural energy. And I'm defining that as more dopamine to suppress the no adrenaline, adrenaline circuits in the brain stem. So,"
