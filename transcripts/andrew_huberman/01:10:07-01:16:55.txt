  "Text": "system is amazing. We're mostly visual animals to navigate survive. Humans mainly rely on vision, not smell or something else. But um a filter for cognition and it's a, it's a strong driver of cognition, just because it came up and then we're moving to higher level concepts just the way the visual system works can be summarized in it. Um in a few relatively succinct statements, unlike most of what I've said, which has not been succinct at all. Let's go there, the retina Yeah. So the retina is three layers of neuron structure at the back of your eye. It's about as thick as a credit card. It is a piece of your brain. And sometimes people think I'm kind of wriggling by out of a reality by saying that it is, it's absolutely a piece of the brain. It's, it's a four brain structure that in the first trimester, there's a genetic program made sure that that neural retina, which is part of your central nervous system was squeezed out into what's called the embryonic eye cups. And that the bone formed with a little hole where the optic nerve is going to connect it to the rest of the brain. And those window into the world is the only window into the world for a for a mammal which has a thick skull. Birds have a thin skull. So their pineal gland sits and lizards too and snakes actually have a hole so that light can make it down into the pineal directly and then train melatonin rhythms for time of day and time of year. Humans have to do all that through the eyes. So three layers of neurons that are a piece of your brain, their central nervous system and the optic nerve connects to the rest of the brain, the neurons in the eye. just care about luminance, just how bright or dim it is. And they inform the brain about time of day and then the central circadian clock informs every cell in your body about time of day and make sure that all sorts of good stuff happens if you're getting light in your eyes at the right times and all sorts of bad things happen. If you are getting light randomly throughout the 24 hour cycle, could talk about all that. But this is a good incentive for keeping a relatively normal schedule, a consistent schedule of light exposure, consistent schedule. Try and keep a consistent schedule when you're young. It's easy to go off schedule and recover as you get older, it gets harder. But you see everything from outcomes in cancer patients to um and um you know, improves when people are getting light at a particular time of day and getting darkness at a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle. We were de designed to um get light and dark at different times of the, of the circadian cycle. That's all being all that information is coming in through specialized type of neuron in the retina called the melan s and intrinsically photosensitive gangly cell discovered by David Burson at Brown University. not spatial information. It's subconscious, you don't think, oh, it's daytime. Even if you're looking at the sun, it doesn't matter. It's a photon counter, it's literally counting photons. And it's saying, oh, even though it's a cloudy day, lots of photons coming in and it's winter in Boston, it must be winter and your system is a little depressed. It's spring. You feel alert. That's not a coincidence. That's these melan options and cells signaling the circadian clock, there are a bunch of other neurons in the eye signal to the brain and they mainly signal the presence of things that are lighter than background or darker than background. So a black objects would be darker than background. A light object, lighter than background. And that all come, it's mainly A P it's looking at pixels, mainly it's, they look at circles and those neurons have receptive fields which not everyone will understand. But those neurons respond best to little circles of dark light or little circles of bright light, little circles of red light versus little circles of green light or blue light. so it sounds very basic. It's like red, green, blue and circles brighter or dimmer than what's next to it. But that's basically the only information that sent down the optic nerve. And when we say information, we can be very precise. I don't mean little bits of red traveling down the optic nerve. I mean spikes neural action potentials in space and time, which for you is like makes total sense. But I think for a lot of people, it's, it's actually beautiful to think about that information in the outside world is converted into a language that's very simple. It's just like a few syllables if you will. And those syllables are being shouted down. The optic nerve converted into a totally different language. Like Morse code, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, goes into the brain and then the thalamus essentially responds in the same way that the retina does except thalamus is also waiting things. It's saying, you know what that thing um was moving faster than everything else or it's brighter than everything else. So that signal, I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna allow up to cortex that signal is much redder than it is green. So I'm gonna let that signal go through. That signal is much uh it's kind of more like the red next to it, throw that out the information just doesn't get up into your cortex. And then in cortex, of course is where perceptions happen. And in V one, if you will visual area one, but also some neighboring areas start getting representations of things like oriented lines. So there's a neuron that responds to this angle of my hand versus vertical, right? This is the defining work of hub weasel's Nobel. And it's a very systematic map of orientation, line, orientation direction of movement and so forth. And that's pretty much and color and that's how the visual system is organized all the way up to the cortex. it's hierarchical. You don't build, I want to be clear, it's hierarchical because you don't build up that line by suddenly having a neuron that responds to lines in a some random way it responds to lines by taking all the dots that are aligned in a vertical stack and they all converge on one neuron and then that neuron responds to vertical lines. So it's not random, there's no abstraction at that point. In fact, in fact, if I showed you a black line, I could be sure that if I were imaging V one I would see a representation of that black line as a vertical line somewhere in in your cortex. So at that point, uh it's absolutely concrete, it's not abstract. But then things get really mysterious. Some of that information travels further up into the cortex. So that and goes from one visual area to the next to the next to the next. that by time you get into an area that um Nancy Kanwisher at mit has studied her much of her career. The fusiform face area, you start finding single neurons that respond only to your father's face or to Joe Rogan's face, regardless of the orientation of his face. I'm sure if you saw Joe because you know him well from across the room and you just saw his profile and be like, oh that's Joe walk over and say hello, orientation of his face isn't there. You wouldn't even see his eyes necessarily. But he's represented in some abstract way by a neuron that actually would be called the Joe Rogan neuron neurons. It"
