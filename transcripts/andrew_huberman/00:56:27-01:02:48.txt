  "Text": "think. Yeah. And I think, um, you know, two things come to mind as you're saying this. Um, first of all, yeah, I mean, we're talking about best for work is not always what's best for, you know, completeness of life. I mean, you know, autism is probably many things like when you hit autism just like feet, there are probably 50 ways to get a fever. There are probably 50 ways to that the brain can create what looks like autism or what people call autism. There's an interesting set of studies that have come out of David Ginty lab at Harvard Med. looking at these are mouse mutants where um these are models for autism where nothing is disrupted in the brain proper and in the central nervous system. But the sensory app, the sensory neurons, the ones that innervate the skin and the ears and everything are, are hyper sensitive and this maps to a mutation in certain forms of human autism. So this means that the overload of sensory information and sensory experience that a lot of autistics feel they like that they can't tolerate things and then they get the stereotype behaviors, the rocking and the kind of the shouting it. You know, we always thought of that as a brain problem. In some cases it might be, but in many cases it's because they just can't talk. They, they seem to have a, it's like turning the volume up on every sense. And so they're overwhelmed and none of us want to become like that. I think it's very hard for them and it's hard for their parents and so forth. I, I like the, the coffee shop example because um the way I think about trying to build up resilience, uh you know, physically or mentally or otherwise is one of um I guess we could call it limb. I like to call it limbic friction. That's not a real scientific term. And I acknowledge that I'm making it up now because I think it captures the concept which is that, you know, we always hear about resilience. It makes it sound like, oh, you know, under stress where everything's coming at, you, you're gonna stay calm, there's a no, you know, so limbic, the limbic system wants to pull you in some direction typically in the direction of reflexive behavior and the prefrontal cortex through top down mechanisms has to suppress that and say no, we're not going to respond to the banging of the coffee cups behind me or I'm gonna keep focusing. That's pure top down control. So limbic friction is high in that environment. You put yourself into a high limbic friction environment mean that the prefrontal cortex has to work really hard. there's another side to limbic friction too, which is when you're very sleepy, there's nothing incoming. It can be completely silent and it's hard to engage and focus because you're drifting off, you're getting sleepy. So their limbic friction is high. But for the opposite reason, autonomic arousal is too low. So they're turning on Netflix in the background or looping a song might boost your level of alertness that will allow top down control to be in, in the play. Exactly the sweet spot you want it. that this is why earlier, I was saying it's all about how we feel inside relative to what's going on on the outside. We're constantly in this, I guess one way you can envision it spatially, especially if uh people are listening to this just on audio is I like to think about it kind of like a glass Barbell where one sphere of perception and attention can be on what's going on with me and one sphere of attention can be on what's going on with you or something else in the room or in my environment. those this barbell isn't rigid, it's not really glass would plasma work here. I don't know anything about plasma. Sorry, I don't know. OK. But so imagine that this thing can contort the size of the, the, the globes at the end of this Barbell can get bigger or smaller. So let's say I close my eyes and I bring all my experience into what's going on in through interception internally. Now, it's as if I've got two orbs of perception just on my internal state. But I can also do the opposite and bring two both orbs of perception outside me. I'm not thinking about my heart rate or my breathing. I'm just thinking about something I see and what you'll start to realize as we kind of use this spatial model is that two things, one is that it's very dynamic and that the more relaxed we are, more these two orbs of attention, the two ends of the barbell can move around freely, the more alert we are the more rigid they're going to be tethered in place. And that was designed so that if I have a threat in my environment, it's tethered to that threat. I'm not gonna be. If something's coming to attack me, I'm not gonna be like, oh, my breathing cadence is a little bit quick. That's not how it works. Why? Because both orbs are linked that uh to that threat. And so my behavior is now actually being driven by something external, even though I think it's internal. And so I don't want to get too abstract here because I'm a neuroscientist, I'm not AAA theorist. But when you start thinking about models of how the brain work, I mean, brain works, excuse me, there are only really three things that neurons do. They're either sensory neurons, they're motor neurons or they're modulating things. And the, the models of attention and perception that we have now 2020 us that we've got interception and exo exception, they're strongly modulated by levels of autonomic arousal. And that if we want to form the optimal relationship to some task or some pressure or some thing, whether or not it's sleep, an impending threat or coding, need to adjust our internal spacetime relationship with the external spacetime relationship. And I realize I'm repeating what I said earlier, but we can actually assign circuitry to this stuff. It mostly has to do with how much limbic friction there is, how much you're being pulled to some source, that source could be internal. If I have, if I have pain, physical pain in my body, I'm gonna be much more interoceptive than I am exteroceptive. You could be talking to me and I'm just gonna be thinking about that pain. It's very hard. the other thing that we can link it to is top down control, meaning anything in our environment that has a lot of salient will tend to bring us into more exteroceptive than interception. again, I don't want to litter the conversation with just a bunch of terms. But um what I think it can be useful for people is to do what essentially you've done. LEX is to start developing an awareness when I wake up, am I mostly in a mode of intero exception or exo exception when I work? Well? Is that is working well, look like? From the perspective of autonomic arousal? How alert or calm? I am I, what kind of balance between internal focus and external focus is there and to sort of watch this process throughout"
