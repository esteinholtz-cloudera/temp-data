  "Text": ", we haven't done too much work there. But what? Um but I think I can comment on it from a neuroscience, which is really all I do is uh well, I mean, we do experiments in the lab but um looking at things through the lens of neuroscience. So what you're describing um can be mapped fairly well to working memory, just keeping things online and updating them as they change and information is coming back into, into your brain. Jack Feldman, who I'm a huge fan of and um fortunate to be friends with is a uh professor at UCL. A works on respiration and breathing, but he has a physics background and um and so he thinks about respiration and breathing in terms of ground states and how they modulate other states. Very, very interesting. And I think um important work, uh has an answer to your question. So I'm not gonna get this. Exactly right, because this is lifted from a coffee conversation that we had about a month ago. But uh so um apologies in advance for the, but I think I can get mostly right. So we were talking about this about how the brain updates cognitive states, depending on demands and thinking in particular. And he used an interesting example, I'd be curious to know if you agree or disagree. Uh He said, you know, most mathematics is done by people in their late teens and twenties and even you could say early twenties sometimes into the late twenties, but not much further on. Maybe I just insulted some mathematicians. But that's, that's true. And I think that it demands, his argument was um there's a tremendous demand on working memory to work out theorems in math and to keep a number of plates spinning, so to speak mentally and run back and forth between them, updating them physics. said, and I, I mean, I think this makes sense to me too that there's a reliance on working memory, but an increased reliance on some sort of deep, deep memory and deep memory stores, probably stuff that's moved out of the hippocampus and for brain and into the cortex and is um more some episodic and declarative stuff. But really, so you're, you're pulling from your library, basically, it's not all ra m it's not all working memory. And then in biology physicists tend to have very active careers into their, you know, thirties and forties and fifties and so forth. Um sometimes later and then in biology. You see careers that have a much longer arc, kind of these protracted careers often, uh, people still in their sixties and seventies doing, doing really terrific work, not always doing it with their own hands because there are people in the labs are doing them, of course. But, um, and that work does tend to rely on insights gained from having a very deep knowledge based you can remember a paper and, uh or maybe a figure in a paper, you could go look it up if you wanted to, but it's very different than the working memory of the mathematician. And so when you're talking about coding or being in that tunnel of thought and trying to iterate and keeping a lot of plates spinning it, it speaks directly to working memory. My lab hasn't done too much of that with working memory, but we are pushing working memory when we have people do things like these simple life tasks while they're under we can increase the cognitive load by increasing the level of autonomic arousal to the point where they start doing less well. And, you know, everyone has a cliff. This is what's kind of fun we've had, um, you know, seal team operators come to the lab. We've had people from other units in the military very, you know, we've had a range of, intellects and backgrounds and all sorts of things and everyone has a cliff and those cliffs, uh sometimes show up as a function of the demands of speed of processing how many things you need to keep online. I mean, we're all limited at some point in the number of things we can keep online. So what you're describing is very interesting because it, I think it has to do with how narrow or broad the information set is. Becau and I don't pro I'm not an active programmer. So um this is a regime I don't really fully know. So I don't want to comment about it uh in that in any way uh that you know, doesn't suggest that. But I think that what you're talking about is top down control. this is prefrontal cortex keeping every bit of reflexive circuitry at bay. The one that makes you want to get up and use the restroom, the one that makes you want to check your phone all of that, but also running these anterior thalamus to prefrontal cortex loops which we know are very important for working"
