  "Text": ", there are some legality issues. I mean conversation, I want to be very clear. I'm not saying that anyone should run out and do psychedelics. think that drowsy states and sleep states are, are super interesting for accessing some of these more creative states of mind hypnosis is something that my colleague David Spiegel, associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford works on where also again, it's a unique state because you have narrow context. So this is very um kind of tunnel vision and yet deeply relaxed, excuse me, deeply relaxed, where new algorithms if you will can start to surface um strong state for inducing neuroplasticity. And think that, you know, so if I had a, um, I'm part of a group, um, that, uh, it's called the Liminal Collective as a group of people that get together and talk about, um, just wild ideas but they try and implement, um, and it's a, it's a really interesting group, some people from a military, from, uh, Logitech and some other backgrounds, academic backgrounds. And I was asked, you know, what would be um if you could create a tool, you just had a tool like your magic wand wish for the day. What would it be? I thought it would be really interesting someone could develop psychedelics that have um on off switches. you could go into a psychedelic state very deeply for 10 minutes. But you could launch yourself out of that state and place yourself into a linear real world state very quickly so that you could extract whatever it was that that happened in that experience and then go back in if you wanted, because the problem with psychedelic states and dream states that first of all, a lot of the reason people do them is they're lying. They say they want plasticity and they want all this stuff. They want a peak experience inside of an amplified experience. So they're kind of seeking something unusual. I think we should just be honest about that because a lot of times they're not trying to make their brain better they're just trying to experience something really amazing. the problem is space and time are so unlocked in these states just like they are in dreams that you can really end up with a whole lot of nothing. You can have an amazing amplified experience housed in an amplified experience and come out of that thinking you had a meaningful experience. When you didn't bring anything"
