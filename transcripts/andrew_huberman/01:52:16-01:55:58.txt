  "Text": "of attention, they couldn't even agree on attention. So I was coming up as a young graduate student. I'm thinking like I'm definitely not going to work on attention and I'm definitely not going to work on consciousness. And wanted something that I could solve or figure out I want to be able to see the circuit or the neurons. I want to be able to hear it on the audio. And I want to record from it. And then I want to do, gain a function and loss of function. Take it away, see something change, put it back, see something change in a systematic way. And that takes you down into the depths of some stuff that's pretty um plug and chug, you know, but you know, I'll borrow from something in the, the military because I'm fortunate to do some work with units from special operations and they have beautiful language around things because their world is not abstract and they talk about 3 m targets, 10 m targets and 100 m targets. And it's not an issue of picking the 100 m target because it's more beautiful or because it's more interesting if you don't take down the 3 m targets and the 10 m targets first, you're dead. So that's a, I think scientists could pay to, know, adopt a more kind of military thinking in that, in that sense. The other thing that is really important is that just because somebody conceived of something and can talk about it beautifully and can glean a lot of um resources for it doesn't mean that it's led anywhere. So, but this isn't just true of the consciousness issue. And I don't want to sound cynical, but I could pull up some names of molecules that occupied hundreds of articles in the very premier journals then were later discovered to be totally moot for that process. And biotech companies fold it, everyone and the lab pivots and starts doing something different with that molecule and nobody talks about it because as long as you're in the game, we have this thing called Anonymous Peer Review, you can't afford to piss off anybody too much unless you have some other funding stream. And I have avoided battles most of my career, but I pay attention to all of it I've watched this and I don't think it's ego driven. I think it's that people fall in love with an idea. I don't think there's any, there's not enough money in science for people to sit back there rubbing their hands together. You know, the beauty of what Neuralink and Elon and, and team because obviously he's very impressive. But the, the team as a whole is really what gives me great confidence in their mission that he's already got enough money. So it can't be about that. doesn't seem to need it at a level of uh I don't know him but it doesn't, he doesn't seem to need it at a kind of an ego level or something. I think it's driven by genuine curiosity. And the team that he's assembled people that are very kind of abstract neurone, neocortex spacetime coding people. There are people like Matt who is a neurosurgeon. You can't, I mean, you know, you can't be asked, neurosurgery, failures in neurosurgery are not tolerated. So you have to be very good to exceptional to even get through the gate. And he's exceptional. And then they've got people like Dan Adams who was at U CS F for a long time is a good, good friend and known him for years. who is very concrete, studied the vasculature in the eye and how it maps to the vasculature in cortex. When you get a team like that together, you're gonna have dissenters, you're gonna have people that are high level thinkers, people that are coders. When you get a team like that, it no longer looks like an academic laboratory or even a field in science. And so I think they're gonna solve some really hard problems. And again, I'm not here. Uh they don't, you know, I have nothing at stake with them, I think that's the solution. You need a bunch of people who don't need first author papers who don't need to complete their phd who aren't relying on outside funding, who have a clear mission and you have a, a bunch of people who are basically will adapt to solve the"
