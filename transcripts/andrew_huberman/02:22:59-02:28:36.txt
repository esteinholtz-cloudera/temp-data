  "Text": "say many friends at MIT, you know, high end smarter friends, Ed Boyden is, is, is, is uh best in class, you know, among the best in class. There's some people, not me that can hold, hold a candle to him, but not many, maybe one or two. I think the the great benefit of being in a place like MIT or Stanford. is that when you look around, you know, that, that the average is very high like the the you have many best in class among the, you know, one or two or three best in the world at what they do. And um it's a wonderful privilege to be there. And uh one thing that I think also makes them and other universities like them very special is that there's an emphasis on what gets exported out of the university, what you know, not keeping it, Ivory Tower and really trying to keep an eye on what's needed in the world and trying to do something useful. Um And I think the proximity to industry in Silicon Valley and in the Boston area and Cambridge also lends itself well to that. And there are other institutions of uh too of course., um the reason I got involved in educating on social media was actually because of a, a Pat Dossett, the Bear Mile bear call guy. I was at the turn of 2018 to 2019. Uh We had formed AAA good friendship and we were, he talked me into doing these early morning um cold water swims. I was learning a lot about pain and suffering, but also the beauty of cold water swims. And, we were talking one morning and he said, um so what are you going to do to serve the world in 2019? Like, that's the way that like a Texan former seal talks. Like, we're just literally like, what are you gonna do to serve the world in 2019? Like, well, I run my lab. I was like, no, no, what are you gonna do? That's new and he wasn't forceful in it. But I was like, that's an interesting question. I said, well, if I had my way, I would just, you know, teach people everyone about the brain because I think it's amazing. He goes, we'll do it and I know all right, he goes shake on it. So we did it, you know, and so I started putting out these posts and it's grown into um include a variety of things. But you asked about a governing philosophy. So I want to increase interest in the brain and in the nervous system and in biology. Generally, that's one major goal I'd like to increase scientific literacy, which can't be rammed down people's throats of talking about how to look at a graph and statistics and, you know, Z scores and P values and uh genetics. It has to be done gradually, in my opinion. Um want to put valuable tools into the world, mainly tools that map to things that we're doing in our lab. So these will be tools um centered around how to um understand a direct one states of mind and body. So reduce stress, raise one's stress threshold. So it's not always just about being calm. Sometimes it's about learning how to tolerate, not being not calm, um raise awareness for mental health. I mean, there's a ton of micro missions in this, but all really maps back to, you know, like the eight and 10 year old version of me, which is, I used to spend my weekends when I was a kid reading about weird animals. And I had this obsession with like medieval weapons and stuff like catapults. And, and then I used to come into school on Monday and I would ask if I could talk about it to the class and teach. And I just, really, I, promise and some people might not believe me, but it's really, I don't really like being the point of focus. I just get so excited about these gems of that I find in the world in books and in experiments and in discussions with colleagues and discussions with people like you and, and around the universe. And I can't just compulsively. I got to tell people about it. So I try and package it into a form that people can access. You know, I think if I've, uh I think the reception has been really wonderful. Stanford has been very supportive. Thankfully, um I've given it done some podcasts even with them and they've reposted some stuff on social media. It's a precarious place to put yourself out there as a research academic. I think some of my colleagues both locally and elsewhere, probably wonder if I'm still serious about research, which I absolutely am. And I also acknowledge that um you know, their research and the research coming out of the field needs to be talked about and all scientists are good at translating that into a language that people can access. And I don't like the phrase dumb it down. What I like to do is take a concept that I think people will find interesting and useful and offer it. Sort of like a um you would offer food to somebody visiting your home. You're not gonna cram foie gras in their face. You're gonna say, do you want a cracker? Like and they say, yeah, and like do you want something on that cracker? Like do you like cheese? Like, yeah, like do you want Swiss cheese or you want that really like stinky like French. I don't like cheese much but um or do you want Foie Gras? Like, what's that like? So you're trying the best information prompts more questions of interest, not questions of confusion, but questions of interest. And so I feel like one door opens, then another door opens, then another door opens and pretty soon the image in my mind is you create a bunch of neuroscientists who are thinking about themselves neuro scientifically. And I don't begin to think that I have all the answers at all. Um I cast a neuroscience sometimes a little bit of a psychology lens onto what I think are interesting topics and, you know, I um you know, someday I'm gonna go into the ground or the ocean or wherever it is, I end up and um I'm very comfortable with the fact that not everyone's going to be happy with how I deliver the information, but I would hope that people would feel um like some of it was useful and meaningful and got them to think a little bit harder"
