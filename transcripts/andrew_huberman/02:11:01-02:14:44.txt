  "Text": ", it's, how are you doing? I don't want to speculate too much, but occasionally David has said this publicly where people will be like, don't you sleep or something? And his process used to just be that he would just block delete, you know, like gone. But it's, it's actually um, it's a super interesting topic and because control and directing our actions and the role of emotion and quitting, these are, these are vital to the human experience and they're vital to performing well at anything and at a high, obviously, at a super high level, being able to understand this about the self is crucial. Um I have a friend who was also in the teams. His name is Pat Dossett. He did nine years in the Seal teams. Um And in a similar way that there's, there's a lo about him among team guys. Um because of a kind of funny challenge he gave himself, which was so he and I swim together although he swims further up front than I do. Um And he's very patient. Um, know, he was on a, uh he was assigned when he was in the teams to a position that gave him a little more time behind a desk than he wanted. And there's not as much time out, out in deployments although he did deployments. Um So he didn't know what to do at that time, but he thought about it and he asked himself, what, what does he hate the most? And it turns out the thing that he hated doing the most was bear crawls, you know, walking on your hands and knees. So he decided to bear crawl for a mile for time. So he was bear crawling a mile a day. Right. I thought that was an interesting example they gave because, you know, like why pick the thing you hate the most. And I think it maps right back to limbic friction. It's the thing that creates the most limbic friction. And so if you can overcome that, then there's carry over. And I think the notion of carryover has been talked about psychologically and kind of in the self help space like, oh, if you run a marathon, it's gonna help you in other areas of life. But will, it really will. It. Well, I think it depends on whether or not there's a lot of limbic friction because if there is what you're exercising not a circuit for bear crawls or a circuit for pull ups, what you're doing is you're exercising a circuit for top down control. And that circuit was not designed to be for bear crawls or pull ups or coding waking up in the middle of the night to do something hard. That circuit was designed to override limbic friction. And so neural circuits were designed to generalize, right, the stress response to an incoming threat, that's a physical threat was designed to feel the same way and be the same response internally as the threat to an impending exam or divorce or marriage or whatever it is, that's stressing somebody out. so neural circuits are not designed to be for one particular action or purpose. So if you can, as you did, if you can train up top beyond control, under conditions of the highest limbic friction, that when the desire to quit is at its utmost, either because of fatigue or hyper arousal, being too stressed or too tired. You're, you're learning how to engage a circuit and that circuit is forever with you. And if you don't engage it,, it sits there but it's atrophied, it's not, it's like a plant that doesn't get any water. And a lot of this has been discussed in self help and growth mindset and all these kinds of ideas that circle the internet and social media. But when you start to think about how they map to neural circuits, I think there's some utility because what it means is that the limbic friction that you'll experience in, I don't know, maybe some future relationship to something or someone will. It's a category of neural processing that should immediately click into place. It's just like the limbic friction you experienced trying to engage in the God knows how many push ups, pull ups and, and running, uh you know, runs, you were"
