  "Text": "would be uh an awareness of anything that's within the confines or on the surface of my skin that I'm sensing. So literally physiological, physiological like within the boundaries of my skin and probably touch to the skin as well. Exteroceptive would be perception of anything that's ex beyond the reach of my skin. So that that bottle of water, a scent, um a sound although, and this can change dramatically actually, if you have headphones in, you tend to hear things in your head if as opposed to a speaker in the room, this is actually the basis of ventriloquism. there are beautiful experiments done by Greg recen zone up at UC Davis, looking at how auditory and visual cues are matched and we have an array of speakers and you can uh this will become obvious as I say it. But you know, obviously the ventriloquist doesn't throw their voice. What they do is they direct your vision to a particular. And you think the sound is coming from that location. And there are beautiful experiments that Greg and his colleagues have done where they suddenly introduce an auditory visual mismatch and it freaks people out because you can actually make it seem from a perception standpoint as if the sound arrived from the corner of the room and hit you like it physically and people will recoil. And so sounds aren't getting thrown across the room. They're still coming from this location, an array of speakers, but this is the way the brain creates these internal representations. And, not to, I don't want to go down a rabbit hole. But um I think as much as you, you know, I'm sure the listeners appreciate this, but you know, everything in the brain is an abstraction, right? I mean, they're, they're the sensory apparat there, the eyes and ears and nose and skin and taste and all that are taking information and with interception, taking information from sensors inside the body, the enteric nervous system for the gut. I've got uh sensory neurons that in my liver, um et cetera all that. And the brain is abstracting that in the same way that if I took a picture of your face and I hand it to you. And I'd say that's you, you'd say, yeah, that's me. But if I were an abstract artist, be doing a little bit more of what the brain does. Where if I took a pen and pad and paper, maybe I could do this because I'm a terrible artist and I could just mix it up. And I, let's say I would make your eyes like water bottles, but I'd flip them upside down and I'd start assigning fruits and objects to the different features that you're facing. And I showed you, I say, Lex, that's you say, well, that's not me. And I'd say no, but that's my abstraction of you. But that's what the brain does. spacetime relationship of the neurons that fire, that encode your face has, have no resemblance to your face. And I think people don't really, I don't know if people have fully internalized that, but the day that I, and I'm not sure I fully internalize that because it's weird to think about. But neurons can do is fire in space and in time, different neurons in different sequences, perhaps with different intensities. It's not clear the action potential is all or none. Although neuroscientists don't like to talk about that. Even though it's been published in nature a couple of times, the action potential for a given neuron doesn't always have the exact same waveform people. It's in all the textbooks, but you can modify that waveform."
