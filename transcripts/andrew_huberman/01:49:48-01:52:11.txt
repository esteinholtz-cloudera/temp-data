  "Text": "I have fortunately three short answers to this. Um uh The first one is, I'm not, I'm not particularly succinct. I agree that the joke I always tell is, um, there are two things you never want to say to a scientist. One is uh what do you do? And the second one is um, take as much time as you need and you definitely don't want to say them in the same sentence. Um, I have three short answers to it. So there's a, um, there's a cynical answer kind of and, and it's not one I enjoy giving, which is that um if you look into the seventies and a back at the 19 seventies and 19 eighties and even into the early two thousands, there were some very dynamic um very impressive speakers who are very smart in the field of neuroscience and related fields who thought hard about the consciousness problem and in love with the problem. But uh overlook the fact that the technology wasn't there. So um I admire them for falling in love with the problem, but they gleaned tremendous resources essentially for nothing. And these people know who they are. Some of them are alive, some of them aren't. I'm not referring to Francis Crick who was brilliant by the way. And I thought the Klaus Tom was involved in consciousness, which I think is a great idea. It's this obscure structure that no one's really studied. People are now starting to study it. So I think Francis was brilliant and wonderful. But there, it, you know, there were books written about it. It makes for great television stuff thought the table or after a couple of glasses of wine or whatever. Um, an important problem nonetheless. And so I think, I do think the consciousness, the, the issue is it's not operationally defined, right. That psychologists are much smarter than, um, a lot of, uh hard scientists in that. For the following reason, put operational definitions, they know that psychology, if we're talking about motivation, for instance, they know they need to put operational definitions on that so that two laboratories can know they're studying the same thing. The problem with consciousness is no one can agree on what that is. And this was a problem for attention when I was coming up. So in the early two thousands people would argue, what is the 10, is it spatial attention, auditory attention, is it? finally, people were like, you know what we"
