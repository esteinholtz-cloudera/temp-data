Vision well, because in the beauty of the visual system, the reason David Hubel and Torsten Weasel won the Nobel Prize was because they were brilliant and forward thinking and adventurous and all that good stuff. But the reason that the visual system is such a great model for addressing these kinds of questions and other systems are hard is we can control the stimuli, we can adjust spatial frequency. How finer the gratings are thick gratings, thin gratings, we can just temporal frequency, how fast things are moving, can use con isolating stimuli, we can use it. There's so many things that you can do in a controlled way. Whereas if we're talking about cognitive encoding, like they, you know, encoding the space of concepts or something, you know, II I, you know, I like you if I may are drawn to the big question in neuroscience, but I confess part because of some good advice, I got early in my career and in part because I'm um not perhaps smart enough to go after the really high level stuff. I also like to address things that are tractable. And I want, you know, we need to, we need to address what we can stand to make some ground on at a given time. They can"
