  "Text": "lab has done that because early on she was challenged by people that said there aren't face neurons, there are neurons that they only respond to space and time, shapes and things like that moving in particular directions and orientations. And it turns out Nancy was right. They use these stimuli called greeble stimuli which um any computer programmer would appreciate which kind of morphs a face into something gradually that eventually just looks like this like alien thing they call the Greeble. And the neurons don't respond to greeble. In most cases, they only respond to faces and familiar faces. Anyway, I'm summarizing a lot of literature, me Nancy. And for those of the greeble people, if there are anything like you don't come after me with Pitchfork, actually, you know what come after with Pitchfork, I think you know what I'm trying to do here. So the point is that in the visual system, it's very concrete up until about visual area four which has color pinwheels and seems to respond to pinwheels of colors. And um so the stimuli become more and more elaborate. But at some point, you depart that concrete representation and you start getting abstract representations that can't be explained by simple point to point wiring and to take a leap out of the visual system to the higher level concepts., we talked about in the visual system, maps to the auditory system where you're encoding what frequency of tone sweeps. So this is gonna sound weird to do but you know, uh like a Doppler like hearing something, a car passing by for instance. But at some point, you get into motifs of music that can't be mapped to just AAA what they call a tonotopic map of frequency. You start abstracting and if you start thinking about concepts of creativity and love and memory, like is the map of memory space? Well, your memories are very different than mine, but presumably there's enough structure at the early stages of memory processing or at the early stages of emotional processing or at the earlier stages of creative processing that you have the building blocks your zeros and ones if you will. But you depart from that eventually. Now the exception to this and I want to be really clear because I was just mainly talking about Neocortex, six layered structure on the outside of the brain that explains a lot of human abilities, other animals have them too is that subcortical structures are a lot more like machines. It's more plug and chug. And what I'm talking about is the machinery that controls heart rate and breathing and receptive fields. Um you know, neurons that respond to things like temperature on the top of my left hand. one of the, you know, I came into the neuroscience from a more of a perspective of initially, of psychology. But one of the reasons I forced upon myself to learn some electrophysiology, not a ton but enough. And some molecular biology and about circuitry is that one of the most beautiful experiences you can have in life, I'm convinced is to lower an electrode into the cortex and to show a person or an animal do this ethically, of course, uh stimulus like an oriented line or a face. And you can convert the recordings coming off of that electrode into an audio signal, an audio monitor and you can hear what they call hash. It's not the has you smoke, it's the has you hear and it's, sounds like just sounds like noise. And in the cortex eventually you find a stimulus that gets the neuron to spike in fire action potentials. They're converted into an auditory stimulus that are very concrete. Crack. Crack, crack sounds like a bat cracking, you know, like home runs, you know, or, or outfield balls. you drop electrodes deeper into the thalamus or into the hypothalamus or into the brain stem areas that control breathing. It's like a machine you never hear. Hash, you drop the electrode down. This could be like a, like a grungy old tugs an electrode, not high fidelity electrode. As long as it's got a little bit of insulation on it, you plug it into an audio monitor, it's picking up electricity. And if it's a visual neuron and it's in the thalamus or the retina and you walk in front of that animal or person that, that neuron goes then you walk away and it stops and you put your hand in front of the eye again and it goes you could do that for two days and that neuron will just, every time there's a stimulus it fires. So whereas before it's a question of how much information is getting up to cortex. And then these abstractions happening where you're creating these ideas. When you go subcortical, everything is no abstraction, it's two plus two equals four, there's no abstractions. And this is why I um you know, I know we have some common friends at Neuralink and I love the demonstration they did recently, I'm a huge fan of what they're doing and, and where they're headed and no, I don't get paid to say that and I have no, you know, business relationship to them. I'm just a huge fan of the people in the mission. But my question was to some of them, you know, when are you gonna go subcortical? Because if you want to control an animal, don't do it in the cortex. The cortex is like the abstract painting I made of your face stim moving, removing one piece or changing something may or may not matter for the abstraction. But when you are in the subcortical areas of the brain, stimulating electrode can evoke an entire behavior or an entire state. And so the brain, if we're gonna have a discussion about the brain and how the brain works, we need to really be clear which brain because everyone loves Neocortex, it's like oh canonical circuits and cortex, we can get the cortical connect dome and sure necessary but not sufficient not to able to plug in patterns of electrical stimulation and get behavior eventually we'll get there. But if you're talking subcortical circuits, that's where the action is. That's where you could potentially cure Parkinson's by stimulating the sub dynamic nucleus because we know that it gates motor activation patterns in very predictable ways. So I think for those that are interested in neuroscience, it pays to pay attention to like is this a circuit that a abstracts the sensory information is it just one that builds up hierarchical models in a very predictable way? And there's a huge chasm in neuroscience right now because there's no conceptual leadership, no one knows which way to go. And this is why I think neuralink has captured an amazing opportunity, which was OK. Well, while all you academic research labs are figuring all this stuff out, we're gonna pick a very specific goal and make the goal the end point and some academic laboratories do that. I think that's a beautiful way to attack this whole thing about the brain because it's very concrete. Let's restore motion to the Parkinsonian patient, academic labs. Do that want to do that too. Of course, let's restore um speech to the stroke patient, but there's nothing abstract about that. That's about figuring out the solution to a particular problem. So anyway, those are my and I, and I admit I've mixed in a lot of opinion there having spent some time like 25 years digging around in the brain and listening to neurons firing and looking at them anatomically, I think given it's 2020 we, we need to uh ask the right, you know, the way to get better answers is ask better questions and the really high level stuff is fun. It makes for good conversation and it has um enormous interest. But I think the questions about consciousness and dreaming and stuff, they're fascinating, but I don't know that we're there"
