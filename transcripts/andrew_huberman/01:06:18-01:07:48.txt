  "Text": ", I mean, there's a lot of fascinating stuff with uh with neuroscience about the fuzziness of all the o of the transfer of information from neuron to neuron. I mean that we, we certainly touch upon it every time we at all try to think about the difference between artificial neuron networks and biological neural networks. But can we uh maybe linger a little bit on this uh on the circuitry that you're getting at? the brain is just a bunch of stuff firing and it forms abstractions that are fascinating and beautiful, like layers upon layers upon layers of abstraction. And I think it just like when you're programming, you know, I'm programming in Python, uh it's awe inspiring to think that underneath it all it ends up being zeros and ones the computer doesn't know about no stupid Python or Windows or Linux. It, it only knows about the zeros and ones in the same way with the brain. there something to you or fundamental to you about the circuitry of the brain that allows for the magic that's in our mind to emerge. much do we understand? I mean, maybe even focusing on the vision system, is, is there something specific about the structure of the vision system, the circuitry of it that uh allows for the complexity of the vision system to emerge? Or is it all just a complete chaotic mess that we don't"
