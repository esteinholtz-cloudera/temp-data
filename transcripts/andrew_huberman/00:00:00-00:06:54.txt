Some people hated it. I misspoke in some parts was more critical on occasion than I meant to be didn't push on certain points that I should have was under educated or completely unaware about some major things that happened in the past or major ideas out there. I bring all that up to say that if we are to have difficult conversations, we have to give each other space to make mistakes, to learn, to grow, one or two statements from a three hour podcast and suggesting that they encapsulate who I am was or ever will be is a standard that we can't hold each other to. I don't think anyone could live up to that kind of standard. At least I know I can't. conversation with Iran is mild relative to some conversations that I will likely have in the coming year.

They have over 45 tools and are trusted by over 6 million marketers worldwide. I personally don't like seo type numbers. But that's basically because I'm an idiot with that stuff. I speak from the heart and data. Be damned. But somebody needs to pay attention to numbers because otherwise you can't make optimal decisions. believe heart comes first. Data second. But both are necessary. I started using them just for fun to explore non numeric things like what kind of titles or words connect with people as a writer. That information helps me in moderation.
