  "Text": ". So you, you know, the stimulus, know, the neuron then codes that stimulus. So you know the transformation when I say this, for those that think about sensory transformations, it's like I can show you a red um circle. And then I look at how many times the neuron fires in response to that red circle. And then I show the red circle a bunch of times green circle, see if it changes. And then essentially the number of time that is the the transformation you've converted red circle into like three action potentials, you know, beep, beep, beep or whatever you want to call it. You know, for those that think in sound space. that's what you've created, you know, the transformation and you march up the it's called the neuraxis as you go from the periphery up into the cortex. we know that I know Lisa um Feldman Barrett or is it Barrett Feldman, Barrett Feldman, excuse me. Um Lisa that um talked a lot about this that, you know, birds can do sophisticated things and whatnot as well. But humans, there's a strong what we call cepal. A lot of the processing is moved up into the cortex and out of these subcortical areas. But it happens nonetheless. And so as long as you know, the transformations, you are in a perfect place to build machines add machines to the brain that exactly mimic what the brain wants to do, which is take events in the environment and turn them into internal firing of neurons.
