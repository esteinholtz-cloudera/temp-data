  "Text": ". I mean, you're testing algorithms, right? You're testing algorithms. So I want to just I know uh some of the people listening to this and you have have basis in, you know, scientific training and have scientific training. So I want to be clear, I think we can be correct about some things like the role of working memory in these kinds of processes without being exhaustive. We're not saying they're the only thing we, you know, we can be correct, but not assume that that's the only thing involved, right. And I mean, neuroscience, let's face it is still in its infancy. I mean, we probably know 1% of what there is to know about the brain. You know, we've learned so much and yet there may be global states that underlie this, that make prefrontal circuitry work differently than it would in a, in a different regime or even time of day. I mean, there's a lot of mysteries about this, but so I just want to make sure that we, we sort of are we're aiming for precision and accuracy, but, but we're not gonna, we're not gonna be exhausted. So there's a difference there. And I think, uh you know, sometimes in the vastness of the internet uh that gets forgotten. So the other is that, um know, we, we think about, um you know, we think about these operations uh at, you know, really focused, keeping a lot of things online. But what you were describing is actually, um it, speaks to the, the very real possibility probably that, that with certainty, there's another element to all this, which is when you're trying out lots of things in particular, lots of different algorithms. You don't want to be in a, in a state of very high autonomic arousal, that's not what you want. Because the higher level of autonomic arousal and stress in the system, the more rigidly you're gonna analyze space and time what you're talking about is playing with spacetime dimensionality. And I want to be very clear. I mean, you know, I'm the son of a physicist. I am not a physicist. When I talk about space and time, I'm literally talking about visual space. And how long it takes for my finger to move from this point to this point,"
