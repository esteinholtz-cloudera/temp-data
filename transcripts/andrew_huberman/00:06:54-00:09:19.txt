  "Text": ". So it depends on the person obviously. Um and we should probably define fear, right? Because you can uh without going too far down the rabbit hole of, of defining these things. Um You know, you can't really have fear without stress, but you could have stress without fear and you can't really have trauma without fear and stress, but you could have fear and stress without trauma. So, you know, we can start playing the word game and that it actually is one of the motivations for even having a laboratory that studies these things is that we really need better neuroscientific and operational definitions of what these things are. I mean, the the field of understanding um and states, which is mainly what I'm interested in is very complicated. But we can um we can do away with a lot of complicated debate and say in our laboratory, what we're looking for to assign at a value of fear is a big inflection in autonomic arousal. So increases in heart rate, increases in breathing, um perspiration, pupil dilation, all the hallmark signature features of the stress response. And in some cases, we have the benefit of getting neurosurgery patients where we've got electrodes in their amygdala and their insula and the orbital frontal cortex um down beneath the skull. So these are chronically implanted electrodes. We're getting multi unit signals and we can start seeing some central features of uh meaning within the brain. And what's interesting is that trivial as it might seem in listening to it, everybody responds to heights and falling from a high virtual place with a very strong stress, if not fear response. And that's because the visual vestibular apparat I right, the the optic flow and how it links to the, you know, balanced semi circular canals in the inner ears, all this technical stuff, but really of that pulls all your physiology, the the feeling that your stomach is dropping, the feeling that you're suddenly you're sweating, even though you're not afraid of falling off this virtual platform. But you feel as if you're following be falling, excuse me, because of the optic flow, that one is universal. we've got a dive with Great White Sharks experience where you actually exit the cage. We went out and put this in the real world and brought back 360 video that's built out pretty. Oh, so this is actually"
