  "Text": ", because if you learn how to titrate caffeine and everyone's slightly different with this, what they need. But if you learn to titrate caffeine with time of day and the kind of work that you're trying to do, you can bring that autonomic arousal state into a close to perfect place and then you can tune it in with, you know, sometimes you want a little bit of background music, sometimes they want less these kinds of things. The, the, the early part of the day is interesting because the one thing that's not often discussed is the transition out of sleep. there's a, a book, um I think it's called Winston Churchill's Nap and it's about naps and, and the transition between wake and sleep as a valuable period. Um I've uh a long time ago. Um Someone who I respect a lot was mentoring me said, um be very careful about bringing in someone else's sensory experience early in the day. when I wake up I'm very drowsy. I sleep well, but I, I don't emerge from that very quickly. I need a lot of caffeine to wake up and whatnot. But there's this concept of getting the download from sleep, which is, you know, in sleep, you're, you were essentially expunging the things that you don't need the stuff that is meaningless from the previous day. you were also running variations on these algorithms of whatever it is you're trying to work out in life on short time scales like the previous day and long time scales like your whole life. And those lateral connections in layer five of the of the Neocortex are very robustly um active and cross sensory areas and, and you're running a, an algorithm or a, you know, a brain, it's a brain state that will be useless in waking. You wouldn't get anything done. be the person talking to yourself in the hallway or something about something that no one else can see. But in those states, you do the the theory is that you arrive at certain solutions and those solutions will reveal themselves in the early part of the day unless you interfere with them by bringing in social media is a good example of you immediately enter somebody else's spacetime sensory relationship. Someone is the conductor of your thoughts in that case. so many people have written about this. Um what I'm saying isn't entirely new but, but allowing the download to occur in the early part of the day and, and asking the question, am I more in my head or external? Am I in more of an interoceptive or exteroceptive mode? And depending on the kind of work you need to do it's, it sounds like for you, it's very interoceptive in the end, very, you got a lot of thinking going on and a lot of computing going on allowing yourself to transition out of that sleep state and arrive with those solutions from sleep and plug into the work really deeply. And then, and only then allowing things like music news, social media doesn't mean you shouldn't talk to loved ones and see faces and things like that. But some people have taken this to the extreme when I was a graduate student at Berkeley. There was a guy there professor is brilliant and odd but brilliant um who was so fixated on this concept that he wouldn't look at faces in the early part of the day because he just didn't want to anything else to impact him. Now, he didn't have the most um rounded life, I suppose. But if you're talking about um cognitive performance, this could be actually be very beneficial."
