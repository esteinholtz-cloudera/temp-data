  "Text": "of it. Well, this was um it's, it's fascinating because I just saw the Oliver Sacks documentary. There's a new documentary out about his life and this one part where he's like, I've spent part of my life trying to imagine what it would like to be, be uh to be a bat or something to see the world through the, the life, you know, the sensory apparat i of a bat. And he did this with his, these patients that were locked into these horrible syndromes that to pull out some of the, the beauty of their experience as well, not just communicate the suffering, although the suffering too. as I was listening to him talk about this I started to realize it's like, well, what, you know, like they're these mantis shrimps that can see 60 shades of pink or something. And they, they see this stuff all the time and animals, they can see UV light every time I learn about an animal that can sense other things in the environment that I can't like heat sensing when I, I don't crave that experience. The same way. Sacks, talked about craving that experience, but it does throw another penny in the jar for what you're saying, which is that could be that most if not all of what I perceive and believe is just um a, a neural fabrication and that for better or for worse, we all agree on enough of the same neural fabrications in the same time and place that we're able to function."
