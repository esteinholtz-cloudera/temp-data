  "Text": ", it's very subjective and it varies depending on task and environment. So one way we can make it a little bit more operational and concrete is to say um there is a sweet spot if you will, where the level of internal autonomic arousal, A K stress or alertness, whatever you want to call, it ideally matched to the speed of whatever challenge you have to be facing in the outside world. So we all have um perception of the outside world as exteroceptive and the perception of our internal real estate interception. And when those two think when interception and exter ion are matched along a couple dimensions, performance uh tends to increase tends to be in, in an optimal range. So for instance, if you're, I don't play guitar, but I know you play guitar. So let's say you're trying to learn something new on the guitar. not saying that being in these super high states of activation are the best place for you to be. In order to learn, it may be that you, your internal arousal needs to be at a level where your analysis of space and time has to be well matched to the information coming in and what you're trying to do in terms of performance, in terms of playing chords and notes and so forth., in these cases of high threat, where things are coming in quickly and animals and humans need to react very quickly. The higher your state of autonomic arousal the better you're slicing time more finely just because of the way the autonomic system works. It, you know, the, the pu pu the pupil dilation for instance, and movement of the lens essentially changes your, your optics and that's obvious. But in with the change in optics is a change in how you bin time and slice time, which allows you to get more frames per second, read out with the guitar learning. For instance, it might actually be that you want to be almost sleepy in a uh kind of drowsy state to be able to and I don't play music. So I can't, I'm guessing here but sense some of the nuance in the chords or the ways that you're to be relaxed enough that your fingers can follow an external cue. So matching the movement of your fingers to something that's pure exteroceptive. And so there is no perfect autonomic state for uh performance. is why I don't favor terms like flow because they're not well operationally defined enough. But I do believe that optimal or peak performance is going to rise when internal state is ideally matched to the space time features of the external demands."
