  "Text": "way that, um, know, of course, you got your, your deep brain structures, they're involved in breathing and heart rate and kind of lizard brain stuff. And then on top of that, this is the, the um, the, the model of the brain that no one really subscribes to anymore, but anatomically it works. And then on top in mammals and then on top of that, you have the limbic structures which gate sensory information and decide whether or not you're gonna listen to something more than you're gonna look at it or you're gonna split your attention to both of sensory allocation stuff. Um And then the Neocortex is on the outside. Um And that is where you get a lot of this abstraction stuff. And now not all cortical areas are doing abstraction, some like visual area, one auditory area, one, they're just doing concrete uh representations. um as you get into the higher order stuff that when you start hearing names like infra parietal cortex and you know, when you start hearing multiple names in the same, then you're talking about higher order areas. But actually, there's a, an important experiment that um that drives a lot of what people want to do with brain machine interface. And that's the work of Bill Newsom who is at Stanford and Tony Mosin, who's runs the Center for Neuroscience at NYU. is a wild experiment and I think it might freak a few people out if they really think about it too deeply. But um anyway, here he goes, there's an area called MT in the cortex. And if I showed you a bunch of dots all moving up and this is what they, this is what Tony and Bill and some of the other people um in that lab did way back when is they show a bunch of dots moving up in MT. There's some neurons that respond, they fire when the neurons move up and then what they did is they start varying the coherence of that motion. So they made it so only 50% of the dots moved up and the rest move random and that neuron fires a little less and eventually it's random and that neuron stops firing because it's just kind of dots moving everywhere. It's awesome. And there's a systematic map so that other neurons are responding and things moving down and other things are responding left and other things are moving right. OK. So there's a map of direction space. OK. Well, great. You could lesion mt animals lose the ability to do these kind of coherence discrimination or direction discrimination. But the amazing experiment, the one that just kind of eerie is that they lowered a stimulating electrode into MT found a neuron that responds to when dots go up. then they silence that neuron. sure enough, the animal doesn't recognize the neurons are going up and then they move the dots down. stimulate the neuron that responds to things moving up and the animal responds because it can't speak, it responds by doing a lever press which says the dots are moving up. So in other words, the sensory, the dots are moving down in reality on the computer screen, stimulating the neuron that responds to dots moving up. And the perception of the animal is that dots are moving up, which tells you that your perception of external reality absolutely has to be a neuronal abstraction. is not tacked to the movement of the dots in any absolute way. Your perception of the outside world depends entirely on the activation patterns of neurons in the brain. you, you can hear that and say, well, duh, because if I stimulate, you know, the stretch reflex and you kick or something or whatever, you know, the knee reflex and you kick, of course, there's a neuron that triggers that, but it didn't have to be that way because A, the animal had prior experience b you're way up in this, you know, higher order cor cortical areas. What this means is that I generally try to avoid conversations about this kind of thing. But what this means is that we are constructing our reality with this space time firing the zeros and ones and it doesn't have to have anything to do with the actual reality and the animal or person can be absolutely convinced that that's what's happening."
