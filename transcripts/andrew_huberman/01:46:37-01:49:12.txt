  "Text": "do the experiment. The key is to just do the experiment in the most ethical way possible. You just, I mean, that's the beauty of experiments. This is why um know, there's, there's wonderful theoretical neuroscience happening now make to make predictions and, but the, but that's why experimental science is so wonderful. You can go into the laboratory and poke around in there and be a brain explorer and, and listen to and write to neurons. And when you do that, you get answers, you don't always get the answers you want. But that's, you know, that's the beauty of it. think when you were saying um this thing about reality and the Donald Hoffman model, I was thinking about Children, you know, um like when I have an older sister, she's very sane. Um uh But when she was a kid, she had an imaginary friend and she would play with this imaginary friend and it had, there was this whole, there was a consistency, this friend was like, it was Larry who lived in a purple house. Larry was a girl. It was like all this stuff that a child, a young child wouldn't have any issue with. then one day she announced that Larry had died. Right? And it wasn't dramatic or traumatic and that was it. And she just stopped. And I always wonder what that, um, neurodevelopmental event was that um, a kept her out of a, a psychiatric ward had she got, you know, kept that imaginary friend. But, but it's also there was something kind of sad to it. think the way it was told to me because I'm the younger brother. I, I didn't, I wasn't around for that. But my, my dad told me that, you know, there was a kind of a sadness because it was this beautiful reality that had been constructed. And so we kind of won. I wonder as you're telling me this, whether or not, you know, as adults, we try and create as much reality for Children as we can so that they can make predictions and feel safe because the ability to make predictions is a lot of what keeps our autonomic arousal in check. I mean, we go to sleep every night and we give up total control and that should frighten us deeply but, know, unfortunately, autonomic arousal yanks us down under and we don't negotiate too much. So, you sleep sooner or later. Um, don't know. Um, I was a little worried we get into discussions about the nature of reality because I'm, I, it's interesting in the laboratory. I'm a very much like, what's the experiment? What would the, you know, what's the analysis gonna look like? What mutant mouse are we gonna use? What, what, what experience are we're gonna put someone through? But I think it's wonderful that in 2020 we can finally have discussions about this stuff and look kind of peek around the corner and say, well, neuralink and people, others are doing similar things are going to figure it out. They're going to, the answers will show up and we just have to be open to interpretation."
