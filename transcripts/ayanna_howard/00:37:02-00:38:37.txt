  "Text": "one of the things I think that we don't get enough credit for um just in terms of as developers is that can now poke at it, right? So it's harder to say, you know, is this hospital is this city doing something right? Until someone brings in a civil case, right? Well, with A I, it can process through all this data and say, hey, yes, there is an issue here, here it is, we've identified it and then the next step is to fix it. I mean, that's a nice feedback loop versus waiting for someone to sue someone else before it's fixed, right? And so I think that power we need to capitalize on a little bit more, right? Instead of having the sensational titles have the OK, this is a problem and this is how we're fixing it and people are putting money to fix it because we can make it better. Um I look at like facial recognition how joy she basically called out a couple of companies and said, hey, and most of them were like, oh embarrassment. the next time it had been fixed, right? It had been fixed better, right? And then it was like, oh, here's some more issues. And I think that conversation then moves that needle to having much more fair and unbiased and ethical aspects. As long as both sides, the developers are willing to say, OK, I hear you. Yes, we are going to improve and you have other developers who are like, you know, hey, a I it's wrong but I love it, right?"
