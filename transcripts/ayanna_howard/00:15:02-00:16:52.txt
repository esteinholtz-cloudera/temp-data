  "Text": "is the human and I think there will be a group of individuals that will swing Right. I just, teenagers, I mean, it'll be adults. Um, there's actually an age demographic that's optimal for technology adoption. Um, and you can actually find them and they're actually pretty easy to find just based on their habits based on., so someone like me who wasn't a roboticist would probably be the optimal kind of person. Right. Early adopter. Ok. With technology very comfortable and not hypersensitive. Right. I'm just hyper sensitive because I designed this stuff. So there is a target demographic that will swing. The other one though is you still have these humans that are on the road, that one is a harder, harder thing to do. And as long as we have people that are on the same streets that's going to be the big issue. Um and it's just because you can't possibly, you can't possibly map some of the silliness of human drivers, right? Like as an example you're next to that car that has that big sticker called student driver, right? Like you are like, oh, either I am going to go around, we know that that person is just going to make mistakes, that make no sense, right? How do you map that information? Or if I'm in a car and I look over and I see, you know, two fairly young looking individuals and there's no student driver bumper and I see them chit chatting to each other. I'm like, oh, that's an issue, right? So how do you get that kind of information and that experience basically an autopilot."
