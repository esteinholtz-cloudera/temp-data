  "Text": "I mentioned, and I truly believe that this whole world of A I is in partnerships with people. And so what does that mean? I don't believe or maybe I just don't, I don't believe that we should have an A I for president, but I do believe that a president should use A I as an advisor, right? Like if you think about it, every president has a cabinet individuals that have different expertise that they should listen to, right? Like that's kind of what we do and you put smart people with smart expertise around certain issues and you listen, don't see why A I can't function as one of those smart individuals giving input. So maybe there's an A I on health care, maybe there's an A I on education and like all these things that a human is processing, right? Because at the end of the day, there's people that are human that are going to be at the end of the decision. And I don't think as a world as a culture, as a society we would totally be. And this is us, this is some fallacy about us, but we need to see that leader, that person as human. And most people don't realize that like leaders have a whole lot of advice, right? Like when they say something, it's not that they woke up. Well, usually they don't wake up in the morning and be like, I have a brilliant idea, right? It's usually a OK, let me listen. I have a brilliant idea. But let me get a little bit of feedback on this like OK. And then it's a Yeah, that was an awesome idea or it's like, yeah, let me go"
