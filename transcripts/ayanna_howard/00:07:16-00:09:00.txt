  "Text": "this is a moving target. So I remember when um the big companies started to heavily invest in this and there was a number of even roboticists as well as, you know, folks who were putting in the V CS and corporations, Elon Musk being one of them that said, you know, self driving cars on the road with people, you know, within five years, uh that was a little while ago. And now people are saying years, 10 years, 20 years, some are saying never, right. I think if you look at some of the things that are being successful is these um fixed environments where you still have some anomalies, right? You still have people walking, you still have stores, but you don't have um other drivers, right? Like other human drivers are, is a dedicated space for the for the cars. Um Because if you think about robotics in general where it's always been successful is, I mean, you can say manufacturing like way back in the day, right? It was a fixed environment. Humans were not part of the equation. We're a lot better than that. But when we can carve out scenarios that are closer to that space, then I think that it's where we are. So a closed campus where you don't have self driving cars and maybe some protection so that the students don't jet in front just because they want to see what. Like having a little bit, I think that's where we're going to see the most success in the near future and be slow moving. Right. Not, not, you know, 55 60 70 miles an hour, but the speed of a golf cart. Right? So that"
