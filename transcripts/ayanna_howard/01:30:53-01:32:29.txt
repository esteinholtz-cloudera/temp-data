  "Text": "if I think about because I try to follow the VC kind of space in terms of robotic investments. And right now, I don't know if they're going to be successful. I don't know if this is a second batch, there's only one batch that's focused on the first batch, right? And then there's all these self driving Xs. And so I don't know if they're a first batch of something or if I don't know quite where they fit in. But there's a number of companies, the coro I call them coro bots that are still getting VC investments., some of them have some of the flavor of like rethink robotics. Some of them have some of the flavor of Curry. What's a co robot? So basically a robot and human working in the same space. So some of the companies are focused on manufacturing. So having a robot and human working together in a, some of these co robots are robots and humans working in the home, working in clinics, like there's different versions of these companies in terms of their products, but they're all. So we think robotics would be like one of the first, at least well known companies focused on this space. Um So I don't know if this, if this is a second batch or if this is part of the first batch that I don't know. And then you have all these other companies in this self driving, you know, space. And I don't know if that's a first batch or again, a second batch."
