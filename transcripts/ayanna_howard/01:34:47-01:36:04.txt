  "Text": "don't singularity would be an example. So my concept is, is that so remember, robots A I is designed by people. It has our values and I always correlate this with a parent and a child, right? So think about it as a parent, what do we want? We want our kids to have a better life than us. We want them to expand, want them to experience the world. And then as we grow older, our kids think and know they're smarter and better and more intelligent and have better opportunities and they may even stop listening to us, don't go out and then kill us, right? Like think about it. It's because it's instilled in them values, we instilled in them this whole aspect of community. And yes, even though you're maybe smarter and have more money and da da da, it's still about this love caring relationship. so that's what I believe. So even if like, you know, we've created the singularity in some archaic system back in 1980 that suddenly evolved the fact is, it might say I am smarter. I am sentient. humans are really stupid, I think it'll be like, yeah, I just can't"
