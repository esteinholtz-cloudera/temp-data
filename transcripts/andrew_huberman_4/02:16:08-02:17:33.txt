  "Text": "don't know. I mean, when, um, excuse me for, for welling up, but it was just, I mean, it's a freaking dog, right? I get it. But for me, it was um the first real home I ever had. Um but when Costello went, was like we'd had this home in Topanga, we had set it up and we're like, and he was just so happy there and I think it just um don't know, it was, it was like this weird like victory slash massive loss like, like we didn't 11 years did everything, everything to make him as comfortable as possible and he was super loyal, beautiful animal but also just funny and fun and, and I was like, I did it like, I like, you know, I gave as much of myself to this being as a human. I felt I could without making it, you know, like, you know, detract, detracting from the rest of my life and he loved and so I don't know um when I think about Barbara especially I, well up and I, and it's hard for me but I mean, I talked to her before she died. And that was a brutal conversation saying goodbye to someone, uh, especially with kids. And, um, that was hard. Um, think that really, um, flipped a switch in me where I'm like, I, I always knew I wanted kids. I say I want kids. I want a lot of kids that flipped a switch in me. I was like, I, I want kids. You want my own"
