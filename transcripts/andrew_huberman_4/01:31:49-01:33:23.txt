  "Text": "was, I was, I was excited. Well, you were just saying, what about these, these covert contracts and animals do them? I think it's simple contextual engagement of, of a neural circuit which is not just nerd speak for saying they do a different strategy. It's saying there has to be a a circuit there. Hardwired circuit maybe learned but probably hardwired that can be engaged, right? You can't build neural machinery out of in a moment. You need to build that circuit over time. What is building it over time? You select for it? The, the cuttlefish that did not have that alternate context driven circuit didn't survive when there was a uh when all the shrimp that they normally disappear. And the, the I spotted shrimp showed up and there were a couple that had some wiring. This is why mutation, right? X men's type stuff is real. Um They had a mutation that had some alternate wiring and that wiring got selected for it became a mutation that was adaptive as opposed to maladaptive. This is something people don't often understand about genetics is that it only takes a few generations to devolve a trait, make it worse, but it takes a long time to evolve an adaptive trait. There are exceptions to that, but often that's true. So a species needs a lot of generations. We are hopefully still evolving as a species and it takes a long time but uh to evolve more adaptive traits, but doesn't take long to, to devolve traits so that you're getting sicker or you're not functioning as well. So choose your mate wisely. And that's perhaps a good segue into sexual selection for humans."
