  "Text": "guy. Definitely. And several members of my podcast team are in excellent relationships. I, think, um, one of the things that rings true over and over again in the advice and in my experience is, you know, find someone who's really a great friend, like build a really great friendship with that person. Now, obviously, not just a friend if we're talking romantic relationship. But, um and of course, sex is super important, but it should be a part of particular relationship alongside or meshed with the friendship. Uh Can it be a majority of the, the positive exchange? I suppose it could. But I think the friendship piece is extremely important because what's required in a successful relationship clearly is in being together., desire to share experience both, you know, mundane and, and more uh adventurous, um support each other, um acceptance, a real uh even admiration but certainly delight in being with the person. You know, earlier we were talking about peace and I think that that sense of peace comes from knowing that the person you're in friendship with or that you're in romantic relationship or ideally both because let's assume healthy relation. The best romantic relationship includes a friendship component with that person. It's like you just really delight in their presence even if it's a quiet presence. Um, you delight in seeing them delight in things. Right. Um That's clear. Uh, the trust piece is huge. Um, you know, and, and that's where people start. You know, we don't want to focus on what works, not what doesn't work. But that's where I think people start engaging these covert contracts, they're afraid of being betrayed, so they betray,, they're afraid of giving up too much vulnerability. So they hide their vulnerability or in the worst cases, they feign vulnerability. Um, that's a covert contract that, that just simply undermines everything. It becomes one plus one equals two minus one to infinity., I think if people can have really hard conversations, this is something I've had to work really hard on in recent years that I'm still working hard on. But the friendship, he seems to be the thing that rises to the top when I talk to friends who are in these great relationships. It's like they, they have so much respect and love and in being with their friend is the person that they want to spend as much of their nonworking, non uh platonic friendship time with and the person that they want to experience things with and share things with. And um, and it sounds so kind of cann and cliche nowadays. But I think if you step back and examine how most people go about finding a relationship, sort of like, oh, like, am I attracted? Of course, physical attraction is important and other forms of attraction too and sort of enter through that portal, which makes sense. That's, that's the mating dance, right. That's the peacock situation. That's hopefully not the cuddle fish situation. Um, but, but I think that, um, there seems to be a history of people close to me getting into great relationships where they were friends for a while first or maybe didn't sleep together right away that they actually intentionally deferred on that. This has not been my habit or my experience. You know, I've got the more um I think typical, like, oh, there's a, an attraction like this person, there's an interest, you kind of explore all dimensions of relationship really quickly, except perhaps the moving in part and the having kids part. Um which ideally because it's a bigger step harder to undo without um more severe consequences. But I think whole take it slow thing. Um I don't think is about getting to know someone slowly. I think it's about that physical piece because that does change the nature of the relationship. And I think it's because it gets right into the more hardwired primitive circuitry around our feelings of, of safety, vulnerability. Um You know, there's something about romantic and sexual interactions where it's almost like it's like assets and liabilities, right where people are trying to figure out how much to engage their time and their energy and multiple people, I'm talking about from both sides, you know, male, female or whatever it sides. But where it's like assets and liabilities and, and that, that's where it starts getting like, um into those contracts early on, I think. And so maybe that's why if a really great friendship and admiration is, is established first, if people are romantically and sexually attracted to one another, that, that piece can be added in a little bit later in a way that kind of just seals up the whole thing. And then, who knows? Maybe they spend 90% of their time having sex. I don't know. Um, that, that's not for me to say or, or, or decide obviously, but there's something there about staying out of a certain amount of, um, risk of having to engage covert contract in order to protect oneself."
