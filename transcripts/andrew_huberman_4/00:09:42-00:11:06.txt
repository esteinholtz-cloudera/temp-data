  "Text": "to, uh, a little bit more. Are you losing weight? I'm not trying to lose weight, but I always do the same fitness routine after like 30 years. Basically, uh, lift three days a week, run, three days a week., but one of the runs is a long run. One of them is medium, one of them is a sprint type thing. So, um what I've decided to do this year was just extend the duration of the long run. And um I like being a mobile. I, I never wanna be um so heavy that I can't move. Like I like, I wanna be able to go out and run 10 miles if I have to. So sometimes I do, and I wanna be able to sprint if I have to. So sometimes I do and um lifting in objects is, feels good. It feels good to train like a lazy bear and just lift heavy objects. But I've also started training with lighter weights and higher repetitions and um for three months cycles and it gives your joints a rest. And um, yeah, so I probably, you know, it, I think it also is interesting to see how training differently changes your cognition. probably hormone related, you know, hormones downstream of training heavy versus hormones downstream of training a little bit lighter. Um I think my cognition is better when I'm doing more cardio and when the repetition ranges are a little bit um higher, which is not to say that people who lift heavy are dumb. Um But there is a cause there's real value in lifting heavy. There's a lot"
