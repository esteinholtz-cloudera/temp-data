  "Text": "are not, we are great friends but we are not an item. That's true. It's official. The um uh I hear over and over again from that have made great choices and awesome partners and have these fantastic relationships for long periods of time that seem to continue to thrive. At least that's what they tell me. And that's what I observe, the friendship first and give it a bit of time before. And so, know, I think that's the feeling. That's the feeling. And, and these are, we're talking micro features and macro features. We're talking, you know, and this isn't about perfection. It's actually about the imperfections, which is kind of cool. I like quirky people. I like characters. I'll tell you where I've gone badly wrong where I see other people going badly wrong. there is no rule that says that you have to be attracted to all attractive people any means, it's very important to develop a sense of taste in romantic attractions. I believe what you really like in terms of a certain style, you know, a certain way of being. And of course, that includes um sexuality um and sex itself, the verb. But it, I think it also includes, there's just general way of being, you know, and, and when you really adore somebody, you like the way they answer the phone when they don't answer the phone that way, you know, something's off and you want to know. And so I think that um, the more can tune up your powers of observation, not looking for things that you like the more that stuff just kind of washes over you, the, the more likely you are to quote unquote, fall in love as a mutual friend of ours. Uh said to me, you know, listen, when it comes to romantic relationships, if it's not 100% in you, ain't happening. And I've never seen violation of that statement where it's like it. Yeah, it's mostly good. And they're, this, is it like the negotiations already? You're, you're, you're, it's doomed and that doesn't mean someone has to be perfect. The relationship has to be perfect, but it's got to feel 100% inside like Yes. Yes and yes, I think Dyer off when he was on here, uh your podcast um mentioned something that, you know, like I think the words were you or maybe it was in his book, I don't recall. But, you know, love is one of these things that we story into with somebody, we create this idea of ourselves in the future and we look at our past time together and then you, you story into it. I mean, there are very few things like that. I can't story into, know, building flying cars. I, I have to actually go do something. I mean, um,, and love is also retroactively constructed. I mean, anyone who's gone through a breakup understands the grief of knowing, ah, like this is something I really shouldn't be in for whatever reason if, because it only takes one, if the other person doesn't want to be in it, then you shouldn't be in it. But then missing so many things. And that's just the attachment machinery really at work."
