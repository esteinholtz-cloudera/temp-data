That's something I talked to Andrew in this podcast about all the thoughts and ideas and memories, or fabricated or morphed or modified or lurk somewhere in the unconscious that one brought to the surface can bring a kind of relief or reinvigoration the way we see the world around us., so many signals and those little neurons firing together construct the experience of the reality we see around us. that's not just the brain that is deeply rooted in all the different systems, including the immune system, billions and billions and billions of organisms, of which are cells, the other half of bacteria all working together to create this experience that we humans call life. And it's so interesting that collecting that data, by listening to the signal that this entire gigantic complex biological systems create, we can start to try to figure out how to improve functioning of it. At first top down in a centralized manner, sort of listening to the music that the orchestra creates and trying to uh maybe rewrite the music or adjust the music or edit the music. interesting this whole journey we're on I'm glad there's people that um that kind of journey into a company and try to help people by, know, making the data from their body accessible and giving advice based on that data, making that advice accessible.

It's just fun to wear a cool thing on a shirt and to celebrate the things you love in this world. I love it when podcasts have merch, especially when they kind of celebrate the specific podcast. And I can connect with people on the street by saying I, I read that too or I listen to that too. I love wearing Metallica shirts for that very reason. I can connect with people, you know, have a similar love for Metallica as I do. And there's just uh number of band shirts that I love wearing because just for that, you can connect with people, they recognize that there's a smile that comes over their face and then you can talk about it and that's the beginning of a conversation and the beginning of a brief moment of exchanging humanity that connects to all of us.
