  "Text": ". A lot of the content of the podcast is, you know, deep app academic content. And we talk about everything from, you know, uh eating disorders to bipolar disorder, to depression, you know, a lot of different topics but the tools are the protocols, as we say, right, the sunlight viewing all the rest. Um, know, a lot of that stuff is just stuff I wish I had known when I was in graduate school. If I'd known to go outside every once in a while and get some sunlight, not just stay in the lab, would have, you know, I might not have hit a, like a really tough round of depression when I was a postdoc and working twice as hard and, you know, when my body would break down or I'd get sick a lot. I don't get sick much anymore. Occasionally, about once every 18 months to two years. I get a, you know, I get something. But, um, know, I used to break my foot skateboarding all the time. I couldn't understand what's wrong with my body. I'm getting injured. I can't do what everyone else can. Now, I developed more slowly at a long arc of puberty. Um, but I, so that was part of it. I was still developing but you know how to get your body stronger, how to build endurance that no one told me the information wasn't there. So a lot of what I put out there is the information that I wish I had had because once I had it, I was like, wow, like a, this stuff really works. B it's grounded in something real, know, some place, sometimes certain protocols are a combination of, you know, animal, human and animal and human studies. Sometimes clinical trials, sometimes there's some mechanistic uh conjecture for some, not all I always make clear which but in the end, like out how things work so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive, suffer less, like reduce the suffering of the world. Um And I, I think that,, I'll just say thank you and um uh for asking about the prayer piece. Um, I'm not pushing or even encouraging it on anyone. I've just found it to be tremendously useful for me."
