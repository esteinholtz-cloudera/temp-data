  "Text": "um simple algorithm, if, if you know, if there's some ambiguity about numbers and I'm not with these guys and, you know, then flip to the alternate strategy. I actually have a story about this that I think is relevant. I used to have cuttlefish in my lab in San Diego. Uh We went and got them from a guy out in the desert. We put them in the lab. It was amazing. And they, had a post doc who was studying prey capture and cuttlefish. They have a very ballistic, extremely rapid strike and grab of the shrimp. And they, um, we were using high speed cameras uh to, to characterize all this looking at binocular, they normally have their eyes on the side of their head. When they see something they want to eat. The eyes trans locate to the front, which allows them stereopsis, depth perception allows them to strike. We were doing some unilateral eye removals, they would miss et cetera. Ok. This is, has to do with eye spots. was during a government shutdown period where the ghost shrimp that they normally um feed on that. We would ship in from the Gulf down here, um, weren't available to us. So we had to get different shrimp. And what we noticed was that the cuttlefish normally would just sneak up on the shrimp. We, we learned this by data collection and if the shrimp was facing them, they would do this thing with their tentacles of kind of enchanting the cle the, the shrimp. if the shrimp wasn't facing them, they wouldn't do it and they would ballistically grab it and, and, and eat them., when we got these new shrimp, the new shrimp had eye spots on their tails. And then the cuttlefish would do this kind of attempt to enchant regardless of the position of the ghost shrimp. So what does that mean? Ok. Well, it means that there's some sort of algorithm in the cuttlefish's mind that says OK, if you see two spots move your tentacles. So it can be, as you pointed out, it can be a fairly simple operation but it looks diabolical. It looks cunning. But all it is is strategy be,"
