  "Text": ", I mean, it right. If I look at the empirical data, I mean, I think about who I chose to work for as an undergraduate, right? I was at, you know, barely finish high school, finally get to college, barely. I, I think this is really embarrassing and not something to aspire to, you know, I was you know, thrown out of the dorms for fighting. Um I barely passed my classes, you know, the the girlfriend and I split up, I mean, I was living in a squad, got into a big fight. I was getting in trouble with the law, then she got my act together, go back to school, start working for somebody who do I choose to work for guy who's an ex navy guy who smokes cigarettes in the fume hood, drinks coffee and we're injecting rats with MD MA. And, you know, I was drawn to it like the personality, his energy. But I also, he was a great, he was great scientist, worked out a lot on a thermal regulation in the brain and, um, and more, um, know, go to graduate school. I'm working for somebody and decide that you doing, working in her laboratory wasn't quite right for me. So I'm literally sneaking into the laboratory next door and working for the woman next door because I like the relationships that she had to a certain set of questions and she was a kind of a quirky person and, you know, so drawn to drama, but drawn to, I like characters. I like people that have texture and I'm not drawn to raw ambition. I'm drawn to people that seem to have a real passion for what they do and a uniqueness to them I, I, you know, you can kind of that kind of, I'll just say how it is. I can feel their heart for what they do. And I'm, I'm drawn to that like, um and that can be good. The same reason I went to work for Ben Barris as a post doc. It wasn't because he was the first transgender man member of the National Academy of Sciences. That was just a feature of who he was. I love he loved Glia. He would talk about these cells like they were the most enchanting things that he'd ever seen in his life. And I was like, this is like the biggest nerd I've ever met and I love him. I think we're, I'm drawn to that. Um This is another thing that conti makes uh elaborates on quite a bit more in the series on mental health coming out. But there are different drives within us. There's this, are aggressive drives, not always for fighting but for intense interaction. I mean, look at Twitter, look at some of the, look at people clearly have an aggressive drive. There's also a pleasure drive. Some people also have a strong pleasure drive. They want to experience pleasure through food, through sex, through friendship, through adventure, you know, but think the Shakespearean drama is the drama of the different drives in different ratios and different people. I I know somebody and she's incredibly kind has an extremely high pleasure drive. Loves taking great care of herself and people around her food and through retreats and through all these things and make spaces beautiful every where she goes and is gifts, these things that are just so unbelievably feminine and, and incredible these gifts to people and the kind and thoughtful about what they like. And then, um but I would say very little aggressive drive um from my read and then I know other people who are just have a ton of aggressive drive and very little pleasure drive. And I think there's this alchemy that exists where people have these things in different ratios. And then you blend in, um, you know, the differences in the chromosomes and differences in hormones and differences in personal history. And what you end up with is a species incredible recipes of drama, but also peace, also relief from drama, contentment. I mean, I realize this isn't the exact topic of the question but, um, someone I know very dearly actually an ex-girlfriend of mine, long term partner, mine um sent me something recently and I think it hit the nail on the head, which is that ideally for a man, eventually settle where they find and feel peace where they feel peaceful, where they can be themselves and feel peaceful. Now, I'm sure there's a equivalent to a mirror image of that for women. Um But this particular post that she sent was about men. And I totally agree. And so, um it isn't always that we're seeking friction, but for periods of our life, we seek friction, drama, adventure, excitement, um you know, and doing hard, hard things. And then I think at some point I'm certainly coming to this point now where it's like, yeah, that's all great and checked a lot of boxes but had a lot of close calls flew really close to the sun on a lot of things with life and limb and, and heart and spirit. And some of, you know, people close to us didn't make it sometimes not making it means their, the career they wanted went off a cliff or the, the, their health went off a cliff or their life went off a cliff. But I think that, um, there's also the Shakespearean drama of the characters that exit the play and are living their lives happily in the backdrop. It just doesn't make for as much entertainment."
