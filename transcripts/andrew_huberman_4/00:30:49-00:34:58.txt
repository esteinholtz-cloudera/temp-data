  "Text": ", a couple of things that I think are hopefully valuable for people here. One is, um, way to destroy your life is to spend time trying to control your or somebody else's past., so much of our destructive behavior thinking comes from wanting something that we saw or did or heard to not be true than really working with that and getting close to what it really was. And, um, you know, sometimes those things are even traumatic and we need to really get close to them and, and for them to move through us and, and that you know, there are a bunch of different ways to do that with support from others and hopefully, but sometimes on our own as well. I don't think we can rewire our deep preferences and what we find despicable or joyful. do think that really a question of what allows us peace. Like, can you be at peace with the fact that you're very self critical and enjoy that? Get some distance from it, have a sense of humor about it or is it driving you in a way that's keeping you awake at night and um and forcing you back to the table to do work in a way that feels self flagellating and doesn't feel good. Um You know, can you get that humility and aware how you're, you know, of your one's flaws and I think that, that, that can create, you know, you know, this word space sounds very new agey, like get space from it is that, you know, you can have a sense of humor about how, how you're neurotic, we can all be. I mean, you know, neurotic isn't actually a bad term in the classic sense of, of the psychologists and psychiatrists, the Freudians. that, you know, the best case is to be neurotic to actually see one's own issues and work with them. Whereas psychotic is the, is the other is the other way to be uh which is obviously not good. So I think um the question whether or not to work on something or to, um, just accept it as part of ourselves, I think really depends if we feel like it's holding us back or not. And, uh, I, I think you're asking perhaps the most profound question about being a human, is, you know, what, what do you do with your body? What do you do with your mind? I mean, if you, it's also question, we started off talking about fitness a little bit, which is for whatever reason. Um, you know, I need to run an ultra marathon? I don't feel like I need to. Um, David Goggins does and, and does a whole lot more than that. So that for him, that's important for me it's not important to do that. I don't think he does it just so he can run the ultras. Um, there's clearly something else in there for him and guys like Cam Haines and, and, and, uh, that tremendous respect for, for what they do and how they do it, um, one need to make their body more muscular, stronger, more endurance, more flexibility? Do you need to read harder books? Do you need to? I think doing hard things feels good. Um, I think it, I know it feels good. I know that the worst I feel the worst way to feel when I'm procrastinating and I don't do something and then whenever I do something and I complete it and I break through that point where it was hard and then I'm doing it at the end. I actually feel like I was infused with some sort of, um, super chemical and who knows if it's probably a cocktail of, of, of endogenously made chemicals. But I think it is good to do hard things, but have to be careful not to destroy your body, your mind in the process. And I think it's about whether or not you can achieve peace on. Can you sleep well at night, stress isn't bad. If you can sleep well at night, you can be stressed all day. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go and it'll optimize your focus. But can you fall asleep and stay deeply asleep at night? Um Being in a hard relationship, some say, you know, that that's not good. Other people like it. Can you be at peace in that? I think uh we all, you know, I have different R PM that, you know, we all kind of idol at different R PM and um some people are big melo costellos and others are kind of like, you know, need, need more friction in order to, to feel at peace. But I think ultimately what we want is to feel at peace."
