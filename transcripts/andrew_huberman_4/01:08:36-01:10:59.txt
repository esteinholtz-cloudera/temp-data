  "Text": "gets to mate first, who gets to eat first? This exists in other animal societies too. But Bob Sapolsky would be a great person to talk about this with because he knows obviously tremendous amount about it and I know just the top contour. But um yes, so number 23 and four males are that he's doing these vigor displays, but they're also aware because in primate evolution, they got some extra for brain too, not as much as us, but they got some and they're aware that the vigor displays are displays that because they've done them as well in a different context, might not just be displays of vigor but might also be an insurance policy against people seeing weakness. Ok. So now they start using that prefrontal cortex to do some interesting things. So, in, in world, if a male is friendly with another man wants to affiliate with him and say, hey, I'm backing you, they'll go over and they'll, they'll um pick off the little gr um parasites and eat them. And so the grooming is extremely important. In fact, if they want to ostracize or kill one of the members of their troop, they will just leave it alone, no one will groom it. And then there's actually a really disturbing um sequence in that show of then the parasites start to eat away on their skin. They get infections, they have issues, no one will mate with them, no one, they have other issues as well and can potentially die. So the interesting thing is, is number two and three, start to line up a strategy to groom this guy. But are actually thinking about overtaking the entire troop setting in a new alpha, but current alpha did that to get where he is. So he knows that they're doing this grooming thing, but they're not, might not be sincere about the grooming So what does he do? He takes the whole troop on a raid to another troop and sees who will fight for him and who won't. This is advanced contracting of behavior a species that normally we don't think of as, as sophisticated as us. So it's very interesting and it gets to something that I hope we'll have an opportunity to talk about because it's something that I'm obsessed with lately is this notion of overt versus covert contracts. Right? There are overt contracts where you exchange, work for money or you exchange any number of things in an overt way. But then there are covert contracts. Um, and those take on a very different form and always lead to, uh, in my belief, bad things. Well, how much of"
