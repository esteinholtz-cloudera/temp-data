  "Text": "tears me up. I cried about him today. I cried about him today. It's, it's, it's proportional to the love. But yeah, I'll cry about it right now. If I think about it wasn't putting him down, it wasn't the act of him dying any of that. Actually, that was a beautiful experience. Um, I didn't expect it to be, but it was in my place when I was living in Topanga during the pandemic where we launched the podcast and I did it at home and he hated the vets. I did it at home and it was, he gave out this huge at the end and I could just tell he had been in just not a lot of pain fortunately, but he had just been working so hard just to move it all. And the craziest thing happened like it was unbelievable. I've never had an experience like this. I expected my heart to break I felt a broken heart before. I felt it frankly when my parents split, I felt it when Harry shot himself. I, I felt it when Barbara died and felt it when you know, when Ben went. Um so as well and so many friends like way too many friends. I mean, the end of 2017, my friend Aaron King, Johnny Fair, John Eckelberry, stomach cancer, suicide, fentaNYL. It's like, whoa all in a freaking weak. And I just remember thinking like what the but when cus like and it's just heartbreaking, you just carry that and it's like, uh, but, and that's just a s a short list, you know, and I don't say that for sob story just for a guy that wasn't in the military or didn't grow up in the inner city. Like, it's an unusual number of like deaths like close people. Um Costello went, craziest thing happened, my heart warmed up. It like, heated up and I wasn't on MD MA and I wasn't, I, I was just, just the moment he went, it just went hush and I was like, what the hell is this? And it was just, it was like a supernatural experience to me. I just never had that. I put my grandfather on the ground. I was a pall bearer at the funeral. I've like done that more times. I'd like to,, to have ever done it and just heat it up with Costel. And I thought what the fuck is this? And it was almost like, and you can make up these, we make up these stories about what it is, but it was almost like he was like, all right, I have to be careful because I will cry here. And I don't want to um it was almost like he was like that effort because I put in putting so much effort into him. I was like, all right, you get that back. It, it was like the giant freaking thank you. it was, it was incredible, you know, and I'm not embarrassed to shed a tear or two about it if I have to. Like, I was like, holy shit. Like that's how close I was to that animal."
