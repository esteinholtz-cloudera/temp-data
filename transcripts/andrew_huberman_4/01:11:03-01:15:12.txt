  "Text": "one thing that we know is true. Dogs and humans, the dog to human relationship is 100% overt. They don't manipulate you., you could say they do in the sense that they learn that if they look a certain way or roll on their back, they get food. But there's no, um, there's no banking of that behavior for a future date where then they are going to undermine you and take your position. Ok. So in that sense, dogs can be a little bit manipulative in some sense. But, um,, ok, so overt contract would be, both want to do some work together, we're gonna make some money. You get X percentage, I get X percentage over contract, which is in my opinion bad. Always bad would be we're gonna do some work together. You're gonna get a percentage of money. I'm gonna get a percentage of money look just like the overt contract. But secretly I'm resentful that I got the percentage I got. So what I start doing is covertly taking something else. What do I take? Maybe I take the opportunity to jab you verbally every once in a while. Maybe I take the opportunity to show up late. Maybe I take the opportunity to get to know one of your coworkers so that I might start a business with them that's covert contracting. you see this sometimes in romantic relationships, one person we won't set the male or female in any direction here and just say it's, I'll make you feel powerful if you make me feel desired. Ok, great. There's nothing explicitly wrong about that contract if they both know and they both agree. But what if it's, I'll do that? But I'll have kids with you. So you feel powerful, you'll have kids with me. So I feel desired. But secretly I don't wanna do that they, one person says I don't want to do that or both don't. So what they end up doing is saying, OK, so I expect something else. I expect you to do certain things for me. Or I expect you to pay for certain things. For me. Covert contracts are the signature of everything. Bad overt contracts are the signature of all things good. And I think about this a lot because I've seen a lot of examples of this. I've anyone, we participate in these things, whether or not we want to or not. And the thing that gets transacted the most,, I should say the things that get transacted the most are the overt things you'll see money, um time sex, property, happens to be um information. But ends up happening is that when people I believe, don't feel safe, they feel threatened in some way, like it's, they don't feel safe in a certain interaction. What they do is they start taking something else still engaging in, in the exchange. And I'll tell you there's one thing about human nature, that's bad. It's that feature, why that feature or is it a bugger feature? As you engineers like to say, um I think it's because we were allocated a certain extra amount of prefrontal cortex that makes us more sophisticated than a dog, sophisticated than a chimpanzee. But they do it too. And because it's often harder to deal with in the short term to deal with the real sense of this is scary. This feels threatening it is to play out all the iterations. It takes a lot of brain work So you're playing chess and go simultaneously trying to figure out where things are gonna end up and we just don't know. So it's a way I think of creating a false sense of certainty. But I'll tell you covert contracts, the only certainty is that it's gonna end badly. The question is how badly conversely overt contracts always end. Well,. The problem with overt contracts is that you can't be certain that the other person is not engaging in a covert contract. You can only take responsibility for your own"
