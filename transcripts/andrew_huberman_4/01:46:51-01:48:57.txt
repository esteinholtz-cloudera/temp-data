  "Text": "has been debated for a long time. And I did a 4.5 hour episode on fertility. And the reason I did a 4.5 hour episode on fertility is that first of all, I find reproductive biology be fascinating and I wanted a resource for people that um were thinking about or struggling with having kids uh for whatever reason. Um And it felt important to me to combine the male and female components in the same episode. It's all time stamped. So you don't have to listen to the whole thing. We talk about IVF and visual fertilization and we talk about natural pregnancy. OK. The data on is very interesting. But let me just say a few things. There are a few clinics now, in particular, some out of the United States that are spinning down sperm and finding that they can separate out fractions as they're called, you know, they can spin the sperm down at a given speed and they, they'll separate out at different um sort of depths within the test tube that allow them to pull out the sperm on or below and bias the probability towards male or female birds. It's not perfect. It's not 100%. It's a very costly procedure. It's still very controversial. Um Now, with in vitro fertilization, you can extract eggs, you can do um introduce a sperm um directly by pipette and it's a process called IXY or you can set up a sperm race in a dish. And if you get a number of different embryos, meaning the eggs get fertilized to duplicate and for start form of blastic, which is a ball of cells, early embryo, then you can do karyotyping. So you can do look for XX or XY, select the XY, which then would give rise to a male offspring and implant that one. So there is that kind of sex selection respect to position, there's a lot of lore that, you know, if um the woman is on top or the woman's on the bottom or whether or not the penetration is from behind, whether or not it's gonna be male or female offspring. And frankly, the data um are not great as you can imagine because those, those would be interesting studies to perhaps. Um There is, there is, there are some, there are, they're"
