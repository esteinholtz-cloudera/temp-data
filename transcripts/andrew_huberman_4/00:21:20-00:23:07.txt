  "Text": ". Yeah. So, so Paul Conti shot, we did. He and I sat down, he did a four episode series on mental health. It is not mental illness, mental health about how to explore one's own subconscious, the self build and cultivate um the generative drive. You'll learn more about what that is from him. He's far more eloquent um and, and clear than I am. Um And he provides essentially AAA set of steps to explore the self that does not require that you work with a therapist. This is self exploration that, that is rooted in. It's rooted in neuroscience. And I don't think this information exists anywhere else. I'm not aware that it exists anywhere else. And um he essentially distills it all down to 1 8.5 by 11 sheet which we provide for people. And um says there, I don't want to give too much away because I would detract from what he does so beautifully. But if I tried and I wouldn't to accomplish it anyway. Um but he said, and I believe that the subconscious is the supercomputer of the brain. All the stuff working underneath our conscious awareness that's driving our feelings and our, what we think are the decisions that um we've thought through so carefully and that only by exploring the subconscious and understanding it a little bit, can we actually uh improve ourselves over time? And I agree, I think that so that the mistake is to think that thinking can override it all. It's a certain style of introspection and thinking that um allows us to read the signals from our body, read the signals from our brain, integrate the, the knowledge that we're collecting about ourselves and, and to use all that in ways that are really adaptive and generative for us."
