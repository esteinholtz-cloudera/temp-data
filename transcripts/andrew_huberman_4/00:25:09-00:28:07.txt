There's the structure of self and the function of self., this will all be spelled out in the series in a lot of detail. Also in terms of its relational aspect between people, how to pick good partners and good relation who gets really into this from a very different perspective. Um Yeah, fascinating stuff. I was just sitting there just I will say this, that, that four episode series with Paul is at least to date the most important work I've ever been involved in all of my career because it's very clear that we are not taught how to explore our subconscious. And that very few people actually understand how to do that. Even most psychiatrists is a uh he mentioned something about psychiatrists. You know, if you're a cardiothoracic surgeon or something like that and 50% of your patients die, you're considered a bad cardiothoracic surgeon. But no disrespect to psychiatrists, there are, there are some excellent psychiatrists out there, there are also a lot of terrible psychiatrists out there because unless all of those, all of their patients commit suicide or half, commit suicide, they can treat for a long time without it becoming visible that, that they're not so good at their craft. Now, he's superb at his craft. And um I think he would say that yes, exploring some shadows, but also just understanding the self. Like what, what you know, under understand like, like who am I? And, and, and what's important, what are my ambitions? What, what are my strivings again? I'm lifting from some of the things that, that he'll describe exactly how to do this. People do not spend enough time those questions and as a consequence, they discover what resides in their subconscious through the sometimes bad, hopefully all also good. But um manifestations of their actions that we are driven by this huge 90% of our real estate that is not visible to our conscious awareness. And we, we need to understand that, know, I've talked about this before. I've done therapy twice a week since I was a kid. I had to as a condition of being let back in school. Um I continue, I found a way to either through insurance or even when I didn't have insurance, I took an extra job writing for Thrasher magazine when I was a postdoc. So I could pay for therapy at a, at a discount because I didn't make much money as a postdoc. I mean, I think for me it's as important as going to the gym and people think it's just, oh, you know, ruminating on problems or getting, no, no, no. If you work with somebody really good, forcing you to ask questions about who you really are, what you really want. Um It's not just about support, but there should be support, there should be rapport, but then it's also should be insight, right? Most people who get therapy, they're getting support, there's rapport, but insight is not easy to arrive at. And a really good psychologist or psychiatrist can help you arrive at deep insights that transform your entire"
