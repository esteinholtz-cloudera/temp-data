  "Text": ", finding the best papers? Yeah, because you have to, you know, read a bunch of reviews, figure out who's getting cited, call people in a field. Make sure that this is the stuff. I mean, you know, I did this episode recently on Ketamine about Ketamine, I wasn't on Ketamine. And um you know, there's this whole debate about S versus RK, I mean, Srk, I mean, and I called two clinical experts at Stanford. I had a researcher at UCL A help me even then, you know, a few people had gripes about it that I don't think they understood a section that I was perhaps could have been clearer about. But yeah, you, you're always concerned that people won't either won't get it or I won't be clear so that the researching is mainly about finding the best papers. And then I'm looking for papers that establish a thoroughness of understanding. that are interesting, obviously, it's fun to, to get occasionally look at some of the odder or more progressive papers that are, you know, what's new in a field and then where there are actionable takeaways to, to really um export those with, with a lot of thoughtfulness. I mean, I think that um going back to the productivity thing. Um, you know, I, I do, I get up, I look at the sun, I, I don't stare at the sun but I get my sunshine. I, it all starts with a really good night's sleep. I think that's really important to understand much so that if I wake up and I don't feel rested enough, I'll often do a non sleep, deep breath yoga nera or go back to sleep for a little bit. Get up really prioritize one. You know, the big block of work for the thing that I'm researching, I think a little bit of anxiety and a little bit of concern about deadline helps, um, turning the phone off helps, um, that those peak hours whenever they are for you, you, you do not allow those hours to be invaded unless there's a, you know, a nuclear bomb goes off. Um, and nuclear bomb is just a, you know, a, a phraseology for, um, you know, it could be family crisis would be, you know, would be good justification. There's an emergency obviously. But um it's all about focus, it's all about focus in the moment. It's not even so much about um how many hours you log. It's really about focus in the moment. How much total focus can you give to something? And then I like to take walks and think about things. and sometimes talk about them in my voice recorder. So I'm just always churning on it all the time. And um then of course, learning to turn it off and engage with people socially and, you know, not, not be podcasting 24 hours a day in your head is key. But I think I love learning and researching and finding that those papers and the information and I love teaching it. And these days I use a white board before I start, I don't have any notes, no teleprompter. Then the, the white board that I use beforehand is to really sculpt out the different elements and, and the flow, get the flow right move things around. The, the white board is such a valuable tool. Then take a couple pictures of that when I'm happy with it, put it down on the desk and these are just bullet points and then just churn through and just turn through and nothing feels better than, know, researching and sharing information and, and I, and as you did, you know, grew up writing papers and it, it's hard and I like the friction of a like uh can't, you know, I wanna get up when he was about, when I was in college, I was trying to make up deficiencies from my lack of attendance in high school much so that I, I would set a timer. I wouldn't let myself get up to use the bathroom. Even never had an accident. But I was, you know, I mean, it was like, I listen to music, classical music, rancid. Few other things, some Bob Dylan may be thrown in there. Um, and just study and just, it, it felt and then, you know, hit the two hour mark and you're in pain and then you get up, you like use the bathroom like that felt so good. There's something about the human brain that likes this, these kind of friction points and working through them and you just have to work through them. So yeah, I'm productive and, and my life is arranged around it and you know, that's been a bit of a barrier to personal life at times, but my life's been arranged around it. I I've set up everything so that I can learn more, teach more including, know, some of my home life and um but I do, you know, still watch Gym Empire, still got time to watch Jim. Look the great Joe Strummer, clash or my favorite mescaleros. He said, you know, this famous drummer quote, no input, no output. So you need, you need experience, you need uh outside things in order to foster the the process. But uh yeah, just nose to the grindstone, man. I don't, I don't know. And that's what, and that's what I'm happy to do with my life. I don't think anyone should do that just because, this is how I'm showing up and, you know, if you don't like me, then scroll. Why they say swipe left, swipe, right. I don't know. I'm not on the apps, dating apps. So that's the other thing I keep waiting for when, um, listens to Lex Freeman podcast is a check box on like hinge or Bumble or whatever it is. But I don't even know, are those that are field is? I don't know what the, what are the apps now?"
