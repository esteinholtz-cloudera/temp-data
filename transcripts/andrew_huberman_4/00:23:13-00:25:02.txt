  "Text": "? You know, there's this idea as you're familiar with too. I'm sure that this young idea that there we all have all things inside of us that all of us have the capacity to be evil to be good, et cetera. But that some people express one or the other to a greater extent. But he also mentioned that there's a unique of people, maybe 2 to 5% of people that don't just have all things inside of them. But they actually spend a lot of time exploring a lot of those things, the darker recesses, the shadows, their own shadows. Um know, I'm somebody who's drawn to goodness and to light and to joy and all those things like anybody else. But I think, um, maybe it's part of how I grew up, maybe it was the crowd I was with, um, um, maybe, but then again, you know, even when I started spending more time with academics and scientists, I mean, um, you see shadows in other ways, right? You see pure ambition with no passion. II, I recall a colleague in San Diego who it was very clear to me did not actually care about understanding the brain, but understanding the brain was just his avenue to exercise ambition. And if you gave him something else to work on, he'd work on that. In fact, he did, he left and he worked on something else and I realized he has no passion for understanding the brain. Like all the, I assumed all scientists do certainly why I went into it. some people, it's just raw ambition, it's about winning. It doesn't even matter what they win. It's just to which to me is crazy. But I think that's a shadow that some people explore. Not when I've explored. Um I think the shadow parts of us are very important to come to understand and look better to understand them and know that they're there work with them than to not acknowledge their presence and have them surface in the form of addictions or behaviors that um that damage us and other people."
