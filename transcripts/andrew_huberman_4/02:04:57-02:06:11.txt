  "Text": ". Yeah. It was weird. I mean, the, the first year of the podcast, it just spilled out of me. It was just, I had all that stuff I was so excited about.

I posted a little bit 2020 as you know, I started going on podcasts. But yeah, I had so I just, just the zest and delight in this stuff. It's like circadian rhythms. I'm gonna tell you about this stuff. I just felt like here's the opportunity and just let it burst.
