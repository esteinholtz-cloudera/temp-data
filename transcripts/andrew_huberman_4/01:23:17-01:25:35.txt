  "Text": "appropriate. Well, can I just tell you about sexual selection? Um I've been watching Life and Color with David Attenborough because I've been watching a lot of nature documentaries talking about inner peace. It brings me so much peace to watch nature at its worst and at its best. So life and Color is a series on Netflix where uh presents some of the most colorful animals on earth and kind of tells their story of how they got there through natural selection. So, you know, you have the peacock with the feathers and it's just such incredible colors like the peacock has these uh tail feathers. Uh the male, are like gigantic and they're super colorful under these eyes it. It's not eyes, it's like I like areas and they wiggle their ass to show the tail, they wiggle the tails. I spots the eye spot. Yes, thank you. You know, this probably way better than me. I'm just quoting it at least, but it's just, I'm watching this and then the female is as boring looking as she has no colors or nothing. But she's standing there bored just this entire display. And I'm just wondering like the entirety of life on earth or not, the entirety post bacteria is like, at least in part, maybe in large part can be described through this process of natural selection of sexual selection. So dudes fighting then women selecting, it seems like it's just the, the entirety of that series shows some incredible birds and insects and shrimp. They're all beautiful and colorful and just a shrimp man to shrimp. There's just, they're incredible and it's all about getting laid. It's fascinating. Like I, I just, um and there's nothing like watching that and champ Empire to make you realize we humans. That's the same thing. all we're doing and all the beautiful variety, all the bridges and the buildings and the rockets and the internet. All of that is, this is at least in part, this kind of a product of this kind of showing off for each other all the wars and all this anyway. Uh Well, there's a, I'm asking"
