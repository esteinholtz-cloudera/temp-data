  "Text": ". Yeah, some close friends of yours have arranged a dinner that I really looking forward to. won't say which night, but it's the next couple of nights. Um, you know, your circadian clock, um, is one of the more most robust features of your biology. I know you can be nocturnal or you can be diurnal. We know you're mostly nocturnal um at certain times of the year locks. But, um, but there are very, very few people can get away with no sleep, very few people can get away with a chaotic sleep wake schedule. So you have to obey a 24 hour A K A circadian rhythm. Um If you want to remain healthy of mind and body, we also have to acknowledge that it's isn't linear, right? So, um what do you mean? Well, I mean, you, the, the degree of change between years, 35 and 40 is not going to be the degree of change between 4045. But I will say this, I'm 48 and I feel better in every aspect of my psychology and biology now than I did when I was in my twenties., sort of quality of, of thought. Um, time spent, um, physically, I can do what I did then, which is probably says more about what I could do then than what I can do now. But if you keep training, can continue to get better. The key is to not get injured. And I, I've never trained super hard. I've trained hard, but I've been cautious to not, for instance, weight train more than two days in a row. I do a split which basically three days a week and the other day a run, take one full day off, take a week off every 12 to 16 weeks. I've not been the guy hurling, the heavy are running the furthest distance, but I have been the guy who's continuing to do it when a lot of my friends are talking about knee injuries. Tell you, hey, hey, um, but of course with sport, you can't account for everything the same way you can with fitness and, and I have to acknowledge that, you know, um, unless one is powerlifting, you know, weightlifting and running, you can get hurt, but it's not like skateboarding where if you, if you're going for it, you're going to get hurt. That's just you're landing on concrete and, it, with jiu jitsu, like people are trying to hurt you so that you say stop. Um, so with a sport it's different. Um, and these days I don't really do a sport any longer. Um, I work out, um, to stay fit. I used to, um, continue to do sports but I kept getting hurt and frankly now like a rolled ankle, um, may put out a little small skateboard part in 2024 because people have been saying we want to see the kick flip and say, well, I'll do a heel flip instead. But, ok, um, uh I might put out a little part because some of the guys that work on our podcast are from DC, I think by now, II, I should at least do it just to show like I'm not making it up. Um, and I probably will, but I think that doing a sport is different. That's how you get hurt, overuse and doing an actual sport. And so, you know, hat tip to those to do an actual sport."
