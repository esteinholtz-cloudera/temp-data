  "Text": "going to see them in Boston on September 18th. I'm literally flying there for, for um uh or I'll take the train from New York. I'm going to meet a friend of mine named Jim. Tha who's a guy who owns a lot of companies, the skateboard industry. Um We're meeting there like a couple of little kids to go see them play amazing, amazing people, amazing, music, very intense, very intense and, but embodies all the different emotions. That's why I love it. Right. They have some love songs, they have some hate songs. They have some. And, um, but, you know, there's a going back to what you said, I think there's a, there's a song, the first song on the, the Indestructible album, I think it, there's a, um it's sort of, he's just talking about like shock and disbelief of discovering things about people that were close to you and you, you know, it's um I won't, I won't sing it but, you know, no, I wouldn't dare. But um there's this one lyric where that's really stuck in my mind for, for ever since that album came out in 2003, which is, um you know, that nothing is what it seems. So I just sit here laughing, I'm gonna keep going on. I can't get distracted. There is this piece of like, you gotta learn how to push out the disturbing stuff sometimes go forward. And I mean, I remember hearing that lyric and, and then writing it down and, you know, that was a time where my undergraduate advisor who was like a, a mentor and a father to me, you know, blew his head off in the bathtub. Mhm three weeks before and then my graduate advisor who I was working for at that time who I loved and adored was really like a mother to me. I knew her when she was pregnant with her. Two kids, died at 50 breast cancer. And then my postdoc advisor, you know, first day of work at Stanford as a faculty member sitting across the table like this from him. I had a heart attack right in front of me, died of pancreatic cancer at the end of 2017. And I remember just thinking like, you know, going back to that song there over and over like, and where people would, you know, I haven't had many betrayals in life. I've had a few but I just thinking like, or seeing something or learning something about something you just like, you can't believe it. And III I mentioned that, that lyric off that first song Indestructible on that album because it's this, the emo like just the raw emotion of like, I can't believe this. What I just saw is so disturbing, I have to just keep going forward. There are certain things that we really do need to push, not just into our periphery but off into the gutter and keep going. And that's a hard thing to learn how to do. But if you're going to be functional in life, you have to and actually just to, to get at this issue of, do I change or do I embrace this aspect of self? Um About six months. It was April um this last year, I did some intense work around some things that were really challenging to me and I did it alone and uh it may have involved some medicine and I expected to get peace through this. I was like, I'm gonna let go of the and I spent 11 hours getting more and more frustrated and angry about this thing that I was trying to resolve. And I was so unbelievably disappointed that I couldn't get that relief. And I was like, what is this like? This is not how this is supposed to work. I'm supposed to be, feel peace, the clouds are supposed to lift. And so a week went by then another half week went by and then someone who I, whose opinion I trust very much, I explained this to them because I was getting a little concerned like what's going on, this is worse, not better. And they said this is very simple. You have a giant blind spot, which is your sense of justice Andrew and your sense of anger are linked like an iron rod and you need to relax it. as they said that I felt the anger dissipate. And so there was something that I think is, it is true. I have a very strong sense of justice and my sense of anger at least uh was very strongly linked to it. So it's great to have a sense of justice. Right? I hate to see people wrong. I absolutely do. And, and I'm human, I'm sure I've wronged people in my life. I know I have, they've told me I've tried to apologize and reconcile where possible, still have a lot of work to do. Um But I see injustice, it draws in my sense of anger in a way that I think is just eating me up and, but it was only in hearing that link that I wasn't aware of before. It was in my subconscious, obviously. Did I feel the relaxation? It wasn't, there's no amount of plant medicine or MD Ma or any kind of, you know, chemical you can take that's naturally just going to dissipate what's hard for oneself. It needs if one embraces that or if one chooses to do it through just talk therapy or journaling or friends or introspection or all of the above, there needs to be awareness of the things that we're just not aware of. So I think the answer to your question, do you embrace or do you fight these aspects of self? Is um I think you get in your subconscious through good work with somebody skilled or, and sometimes that involves the tools I just mentioned in various combinations and you figure it out, you figure out if it's serving you, obviously, it was not bringing me peace. It was undermining my, my sense of justice was undermining my sense of peace. so in understanding this link be, now, I would say that the, in understanding this link between justice and anger now, I think it's a little bit more of like a, know, it's not like a Twizzler stick bendy, but it's at least it's not like an iron rod. Like, you know, when I see somebody wrong, I mean, it used to just like, like immediately but"
