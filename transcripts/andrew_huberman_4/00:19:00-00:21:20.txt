  "Text": "don't recall ever really listening to my parents that much. You know, I grew up in a, you know, we don't have to go back to my childhood thing, but my sense was, thank you. I learned that recently in a in a psilocybin journey. Um My first, my first high dose psilocybin journey, which was um welcome back, done with a clinician. Thank you very much. Thank you. I was worried there for a second point. Am I not coming back? But in, in any event? Um Yeah, I grew up with some wild kids. You know, I would say about a third of my friends from childhood are dead or in jail. Um about a third have gone on to do tremendously impressive things. Start companies, excellent athletes, uh academics, um scientists and um and clinicians and, and then about a third are living their lives as kind of more typical. I just mean um they are happy, family people uh with jobs that they mainly um serve the function to make money. They're not sort of career into their career for career's sake. But um some of my friends early on gave me some bad ideas. Um but most of the time my bad ideas came from um overriding the signals that I knew that my body and I would say my body and brain were telling me uh to obey.

And um and um he the opposite of what most say about the brain, which is most people say, oh, the supercomputer of the brain is the forebrain. It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate put on there. And the forebrain is what makes us human. Um And gives us our, our superpowers. Paul has said. Um he's done a whole series on mental health that's coming out from our podcast in September. So this is not an attempt to plug that, but he'll elaborate on what"
