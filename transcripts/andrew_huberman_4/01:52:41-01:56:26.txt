  "Text": ", and some of them, some of them not all quite reputable. Um And some of them really pioneering in the sense that they've taken on topics that are, you know, considered, you know, outside the main frame of what people talk about, but they are very important. Um We have episodes coming out soon with, for instance, the head of um male urology, sexual health and reproductive health at Stanford Michael Eisenberg. But also um you know, one with a female urologist, sexual health, reproductive health, uh Doctor Rena Malik on has a quite active youtube presence. She does these really um like dry um pre like scientific presentation, but very nice. She has a lovely voice and she, but she'll be talking about, you know, erections or squirting or like all. Is it like she does like very kind of internet type content. Um But she's a legitimate neurologist, reproductive health expert. And in the podcast, we, we did talk about um male and female orgasm. We talked a lot about sexual function dysfunction. We talked a lot about pelvic floor. One interesting factoid is that three, only 3% of sexual dysfunction is endocrine in nature. Uh It's more often related to some pelvic floor or uh vasculature, blood flow related or other issue. Um And then when Eisenberg came on the podcast, he said that far less sexual dysfunction is psychogenic in origin, people believe that far more of it is pelvic floor, neuro and vascular. So, you know, there's, there are the myths of um I mean, it's not saying that it's that psychogenic dysfunction doesn't exist but that a lot of the sexual dysfunction that people assume is related to hormones or that is related to psychogenic issues are related to vascular or neural issues. And the good news is that there are great remedies for those. And um and so those both those episodes detail some of the more salient points around what those remedies are and could be, I mean, one of the kind of again, but it's interesting that, you know, a lot of people have pelvic floor issues and they think that their pelvic floors are um quote unquote messed up. So they go on the internet, they learn about Kegels, Kegels that, you know, and it turns out that some people need Kegel, they need to strengthen their pelvic floor. Guess what? huge number of people with sexual and neurologic pelvic floors that are too tight and Kegels are going to make them far worse and they actually need to learn to relax their pelvic floor. And so seeing a pelvic floor specialist is important. I think in the next 5, 10 years, we're going to see a dramatic shift towards more discussion about sexual and reproductive health in a way that acknowledges that, yeah, the clitoris is comes from the same origin tissue as the the penis. And in many ways, the the neural innervation of the two while clearly different has some uh overlapping features that um know that there's going to be discussion around kind of anatomy and hormones and pelvic floors. And um in a way that's gonna, you know, um some of the the kind of like cloaking of these topics uh because they've been cloaked for a long time and there's a lot of like,, let's just call it what it is. There's a lot of bullshit out there about what's what um and now the hormonal issues, by the way, just to clarify can impact desire. So a lot of people who have lack of desire as opposed to lack of anatomical function, this could be male or female that, that can originate with either things like ssris or, or hormonal issues. And so we talk about that as well. So it's a pretty vast topic. Ok."
