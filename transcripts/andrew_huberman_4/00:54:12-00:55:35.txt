  "Text": ", definitely. I mean, I think that um I think there's real peace with age. I think the other thing is this notion of checking boxes is a real thing., for me anyway, I, I have a morning meditation that I do. Um Well, I wake up now I get my sunlight, I hydrate, I use the bathroom. I do all the things that I talk about. Um I've, I've started to practice a prayer in the last year which is new ish for me, which is, we could talk about it in the morning. Can you talk about it a little bit? Sure. Yeah. And I, and then I have a meditation that I do. That actually is where I think through with the different roles that I play., like I start very basic. Um I say, you know, ok, I'm an animal. Like we are, we are like biologically animals, right? Human. You know, I'm a man, I'm a scientist, I'm a teacher, I'm a friend, I'm a brother, I'm a son. You know, I go through this, I have this list and I think about the different roles that I have and the roles that I still want in my life going forward that I haven't yet fulfilled. just takes me it, it's sort of an inventory of where I've been, where I'm at and where I'm going as they say. Um and I don't know why I do it, but I started doing it this last year, I think because um it helps me understand just how many different context I have to exist in and, and, and remind myself that there's still more that I haven't done that I'm excited about."
