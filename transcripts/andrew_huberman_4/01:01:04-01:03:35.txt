  "Text": "then you can't control everything. I mean, you go through life as a hard driving person, you know, forward center of mass. I remember being that way since I was little, like a Lego. So I'm like all the Legos. So I was like on the weekends, you know, learning about medieval weapons and then giving lectures about it in class when I was five or six years old, we're learning about tropical fish and, you know, cataloging all of them at the store and then organizing it and make my, you know, my dad drive me or my mom drive me at some fish store and then spending all my time there until they throw me out, you know, all of that. But I also remember my entire life, I would secretly pray things were good and things weren't good. But mostly when things weren't good because it's important to pray for me. It's important to pray each morning regardless. But when things right, I couldn't make sense of them. I would secretly pray, but I felt kind of ashamed of that for whatever reason. And then it was once in college, I distinctly remember I, I was having a hard time with a number of things. Um, and I took a run to sands beach. It was UC San Barbara. And I remember I just, I was like, I don't know if I even have the right to, to do this, but I'm just praying. I just prayed for uh ability to be as brutally honest with myself and with other people as I possibly could be about a particular situation I was in at that time. I mean, I, I think now it's probably safe to say I, I'd gone off to college because of a high school girlfriend. We had, we see essentially she was my family, more frankly, more than my biological family was at, at a certain stage of life. And we'd reached a point where we were diverging and it was, it was incredibly painful. It was like losing everything I had. And it was like, what do I do? How do I manage this? Do I, know, I was ready to quit and join the fire service just to support us so that we could move forward and, and, um, and, you know, it's just, but praying just saying, I can't figure this out on my own. It's sort of like, I can't think of this out on my own and how frustrating that is no number of friends could tell me or, and in her wisdom couldn't tell me. And eventually it led me to, to the right answers and she and I are, are friendly friends to this day. She's happily married with a child and, um, we're on good terms. But I think, know, it's, a, it's a scary thing, but it's the best thing when you, I, I can't control all of this and asking for help I think is also the piece you're not asking for some magic hand to come down and take care of it. You're asking for the help to come through you, right? So that your body is used to do these right works, right? Action."
