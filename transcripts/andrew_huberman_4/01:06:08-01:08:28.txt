  "Text": "then it got cluttered over. Well, listen, I can't wait for you and conti to talk again because he gets going about the subconscious and the amount of this that sits below the surface like an iceberg and, I, and the fact that when we're kids, we're, we're not a lot of that subconscious as, as much. And, and sometimes I can look a little more primitive. I mean, I mean, that kid that's disappointed will let you know the kid that's excited, will let you know and you feel that raw exuberance or that raw dismay. And I think that um as we grow older, we learn to cover that stuff up. We, we, we wear masks and we have to, to be functional and I don't think we all want to go around just being completely um raw. But you said, as you get older, you also, you get to this point where you kind of go, uh you know, what, what are we really trying to protect anyway? I mean, I have this theory that, know, certainly my experience has taught me that a lot of people, but talk about men because that's what I know best or not they show up strong or not that they're really afraid of weak, like they're just afraid. Like sometimes the strength is even a way to try and not be weak, right? Which is different than being strong for its own sake. I'm not just talking about physical strength. I'm talking about intellectual strength. I'm talking about money. I'm talking about um expressing drive. I've been watching this um series a little bit of uh Chimp Empire. Yeah. So Chimp Empire is amazing. Right? They have the head chimp that he's not the head chimp, but the, the, the alpha in the group. Yeah. he's getting older. And so what does he do every once in a while? He goes on these vigor displays? He goes and he grabs branch, he starts breaking, he starts thrashing him and he's incredibly strong and they're all kind of like watching, I mean, yeah, I immediately think of people like they're dead lifting on Instagram. And I just think v displays of vigor. This is just the primate showing that displays the vigor. Now, what's interesting is that he's doing that specifically to say, hey, I still have what it takes to lead this troop. OK. there are the, the ones that are subordinate to him but not so not so far behind."
