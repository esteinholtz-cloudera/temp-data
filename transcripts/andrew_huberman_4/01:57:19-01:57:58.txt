  "Text": "? Yes. So we've pushed out episodes because I want more time with them. I also, I haven't advertised this. Um but I have another uh fully tenured professor that's started um checking my my um podcasts and helping me find papers. He's a close friend of mine. He's an incredible expert in neuroplasticity and that's been helpful. But I research all my, do all the primary research for the episodes myself. Although my niece has been doing a summer internship with me and finding amazing papers. She did last summer as well. She's really good at it.
