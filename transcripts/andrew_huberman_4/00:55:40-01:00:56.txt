  "Text": ". Yeah. And I'm ambitious. So I think, you know, I'm a brother. I have, I have an older sister and I love her tremendously and I think I, I wanna be the best brother I can be to her, which means maybe a call, maybe just um know, we do an annual trip together for our birthdays, our birthdays are close together. We always go to New York for our birthdays. If we've gone for the last 34 years, like really, like reminding myself of that role. Not because I'll forget, but because I have all these other roles I'll get pulled into. I say the first one, I'm an animal because I have to remember that I have a body that needs care any of us, I need sleep. I need food, I need hydration. I need that I'm human that, that the brain of a human is, is marvelously complex, but also um marvelously uh self defeating at times. And so I've been thinking about these things in the context of the different roles and the whole thing takes about four or five minutes. And I just find it brings me a certain amount of clarity that then allows me to ratchet into the day, the prayer piece. Um Yeah, I'm, I, I think I've been reluctant to talk about um until, um because I don't believe in pushing religion on people. And um I think that um and I'm not, um it's a highly individual thing and I do believe that one can be an atheist and still pray um or agnostic and still pray. But uh for me, it really came about through understanding that there are certain of myself that I just couldn't resolve on my own and no matter how much therapy, no matter how much and I haven't done a lot of it but no matter how much plant medicine or other sorts of medicine or exercise or um podcasting or science or friendship or any of that, I was just not going to resolve. And so, um I started this because, uh, close to me, um said, a male friend said, you know, is powerful. And I said, well, how, and he said, I don't know how. But if you, if you can get, it can allow you to get outside yourself. Get let you give up control. And at the same time, take control. I don't even like saying, take control. But the whole notion is that, forgive me. But there's no other way to say it. The whole notion is that, you know, like God works through us, whatever God is to you, he he him, her, whatever uh life force like nature, whatever it is to you, right? That it works through us. And so I do a prayer, I'll just describe it where I, I ask, um I, I make an ask uh to help remove my defects, my character defects. I, I pray to God to help remove my character defects so that I can show up better in all the roles of my life and do good work like to which for me is learning and teaching, learning and teaching. And, and, and so you might say, well, how is that different than a meditation? Well, it, I'm acknowledging that there is something that bigger than me, bigger than nature as I understand it, that I cannot understand or control nor do I want to. And I'm just giving over to that. And that make me less of a scientist? I, I sure as hell hope not. I certainly know. I, there's the head of our Neurosciences at Stanford until recently. Um, I, you should talk to him directly about it. Bill Newsom has talked about his religious life. Um For me, it's really a way of getting outside myself and then understanding how I fit into this bigger picture and it's, and the character defects part is real, right? I'm a human. I have defects like I got a lot of flaws me like anybody but um and trying to acknowledge them and asking for help in removing them, not magically but through right action, through my right action. I do that every morning. And um I have to say that it's helped, it's helped a lot. It's helped me be better to myself, be better to other people. Um I still make mistakes. Um But it's a, it's becoming a bigger, bigger part of my life and I never thought I'd talk like this. Um But think um, it's clear to me that we don't in something again, doesn't have to be traditional standardized religion. But if we don't believe in something bigger than ourselves, we uh at some level, will self destruct really, I really think so. It's p and it's powerful in a way that all the other stuff, meditation and all the tools is, is not because it's really operating at a, at a much deeper and bigger level. And, um, you know, if,, I think that, I think that's all I can talk about it. Um, mostly because I'm still working out, uh, you know, the scientist in me wants to understand how it works and I want to understand and the point is to just go, you know, there's some, there's, you know, for lack of a better language for it, there's higher power than me and what I can control, I'm giving up control on certain things and somehow that restores a sense of agency right action, better action."
