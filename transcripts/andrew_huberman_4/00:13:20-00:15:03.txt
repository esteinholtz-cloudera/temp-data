  "Text": ". Yeah. The, um, practice I've been doing a lot more of lately is I walk while reading a book in the yard. I'll just pace back and forth or walk in a circle audio. Or are you talking hard copy? You just holding the book and I'm walking and I'm reading. Yeah. And I usually have a pen and I'm underlining I have this whole system like underlining stars, exclamation points goes back to University of what things that will go back to um which things I export to notes and that kind of thing. But from the beginning, uh when I opened my lab at that time in San Diego, before I moved back to Stanford, um I would have meetings with my students or postdocs by just walking in the field behind the lab. Um You know, and I'd bring my Costello bulldog mastiff at the time and he's, he was a slow walker. So these were slow walks, but I can think much more clearly that way. There's a Nobel Prize winning uh professor at Columbia University School of Medicine, Richard Axel who won the Nobel Prize, Coon Nobel Prize with Linda Buck for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction. And he walks in voice dictates his papers and now with REV or these other, maybe there are better ones than rev where you can convert audio files into text very quickly and then edit from there. So I will often voice dictate um first drafts and things like that. And um I totally agree on the long runs, the walks, the integrating that with cognitive work harder to do with sprints. Um And then the gym, you know, are you, you weight train, you just seem naturally strong and like thicker jointed. true. It's true. I mean, we did the one very beginner because I'm a very beginner of jiu jitsu class together. And um yeah, as I mentioned then, uh what if people missed it? Lex is freakishly strong."
