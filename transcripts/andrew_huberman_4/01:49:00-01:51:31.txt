  "Text": "lot of, and there are a lot of other variables that are hard to control. So for instance, if it, if it's um ejaculation during intermission, during, during sex penetration, et cetera, um then you can't measure, for instance, sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF and they can actually measure how many milliliters, how many forward motile sperm, it's hard to control for, for certain things. um it just can vary between individuals and even from one ejaculation to the next. And OK, so there's too many variables. However, the position thing is interesting the following way. Um And then I'll answer whether or not you can bias towards a female. Um As long as we're, as long as we're talking about other questions about sex. As long as we're talking about sexual position, there are data support the idea that in order to increase the probability of successful, indeed the woman should not stand up right after sex and should right after right after the man is ejaculated inside her and should adjust her pelvis, say 15 degrees upwards. I mean, you know, some of the fertility experts M Ds will say that's crazy, you know, but others that I out and um not specifically for this answer, but um for researching that episode said that, yeah, you know what you're talking about is trying to get the maximum number of sperm and it's contained in semen. And yes, the semen can leak out. And so keeping um the pelvis tilted for about 15 degrees for about 15 minutes, obviously tilted in the direction that would have things running upstream, not downstream, to speak with gravity, it's real. Um You know, um so, so for maximizing fertilization, you know that the doctors I spoke to just said, look, given that if people are trying to get pregnant, what is spending 15 minutes on their back? Um You know, this sort of thing. OK. So then with respect to the, to female, getting a female offspring or XX offspring, um, there is the idea that as fathers get older, they're more likely to have daughters as opposed to sons. That's a, the papers I've read is a significant but still mildly significant result. So with each passing year, um this person um increases the probability they're gonna have a daughter and not a son look. Um So that's interesting. But the probability"
