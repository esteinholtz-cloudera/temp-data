  "Text": ", the best lecturers as you know, and you're in a phenomenal lecturer. So you embody this as well. But the, when I teach at Stanford, I was directing this course in Neuron and Neuroscience and for medical students. And I noticed that the best lecturers would come in they're teaching the material from a place of deep understanding, but they're also experiencing it as a first time learner as at the same time. So it's just sort of embodying the delight of it, but also the authority over the not authority but the, the sort of mastery of the material. And it's really the delight in it that the students are linking on to and of course they need and deserve the best accurate material. So they have to know what they're talking about. But yeah, just tap into that energy of learning and loving it and people are, are along for the ride or, you know, I get accused of being long winded but you know, things get taken out of context that leads to greater misunderstanding. And also I look at, listen, I come from a lineage of three, dead advisor, three, all three. I don't know when the reaper coming for me, I'm doing my best to stay alive a long time. But whether or not it's a bullet or a bus or cancer or whatever or just old age. I mean, I'm trying to get it all out there best I can and, and if it means you have to hit pause and come back a day or two later, like that seems like a reasonable compromise to me. I'm not gonna go um go longer than I need to and I'm trying to shorten them up. But uh again, that's, it's kind of how I show up. It's like Tim Armstrong would say about writing songs. I asked him, do you write? How often you write every day, day is Rick ever stopped creating? No. Is Joe ever stopped preparing for comedy? Are you ever stopping to think about world issues and, and technology and who you can talk to? I mean, it seems to me you've always got a plan inside the, the thing I love about your podcast the most, be honest these days is the surprise of like, I don't know who the hell is going to be there. It's almost like, like I get a little nervously excited about when a new episode comes. Like, because I have no idea, no idea. And, you know, I mean, I have some guesses based on what you told me during the break. I mean, you've got someone, people where it's just like, Lexus went there. Awesome. Can't wait, click. You know, they're, you know, I think that's really cool. Like you're constantly surprising people. So you, you're doing it so well, like, it's such a high level and I think it's also important for people to understand that what you're doing. Lax. no precedent for it. Sure. There have been interviews before. There have been podcasts before there are discussions before, but it's not like how many of your peers can you look to, to find out how best to do the content like yours. Zero, there's one peer you so, you know, that should give you great peace and great excitement because you're, you're a pioneer, you're the, you're literally the tip of the spear. I, I don't want to take an unnecessary tangent, but I, I think this might thread together two of the things that we've been talking about, which are I think of pretty key importance. One is romantic relationships and the other is creative process and work. And this again is something I, I learned from Rick, but that he and I have gone back and forth on and that um I think is worth elaborating on which is we were saying, you know, the best relationship is going to be one where you, where it brings you peace. I think peace also can be translated to among other things. of distraction. So when you're with your partner, can you really focus on them and the relationship, can you not be distracted by that you're upset about from their past or from your past with them or they're, and of course, the same is true for them, right? They, they will ideally will feel that way towards you too. They can really focus also you're not with them. Can you focus on your work? Can you not be worried about whether or not they're ok because you trust that they're an adult and they can handle things or they will reach out if they need things, um They're gonna communicate their needs like an adult, you know, not creating messes just to get attention and things like that or or disappearing, you know, for that matter. So, and focus are intimately related and distraction is the enemy of peace and focus. there's something there I believe. Um because with people that have the strong generative drive and, and want to, you know, be productive in their home life, in the sense I have a rich family life, um or partner life, whatever that is and in their work life, you know, the ability to really drop into the work and like, OK, you might have that sense, like, I hope they're ok or, you know, need to check my phone or something but just know like we're good. So, so peace and focus, I think and present, being present so key and then it's key at every level of romantic relationship from um you know, certainly presence and focus, you know, everything from sex to listening to um to, you know, raising a family, to tending to the house. Um And in work, it's absolutely critical. So I think that those things are kind of mirror images of the same thing and they're both important reflections of the other. And when you start to just, you know, when work is going well, then the relationship, the focus on relationship can suffer and vice versa."
