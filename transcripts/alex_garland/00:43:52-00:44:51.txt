  "Text": "don't, I don't buy that. Yeah. So, so the idea that that there is a thing that it would be like to be the sun. Yeah. No, iii I don't buy that. I think that consciousness is a thing. The, the my sort of broad modification is that usually the more I find out about things, the more illusory instinct is and is leading us into a different direction about what that thing actually is that that happens. It seems to me in, in modern science that happens a hell of a lot. Um whether it's to do with how even how big or small things are. So, so my sense is that consciousness is a thing but it isn't quite the thing or maybe very different from the thing that we instinctively think it is. So it's there, it's very interesting, but we may be sort of quite fundamentally misunderstanding it for reasons that are based on intuition."
