  "Text": ", true, course. But what this machine would do is is prove it beyond any doubt because someone would say, well, I don't believe that's true. And then you'd, you'd predict well, in 10 seconds you're going to do this and they'd say no, no, I'm not. And then they'd do it and then determinism would have played its part, but I, or, or, or something like that. But, um, actually the exact terms of that thought experiment probably wouldn't play out. But, still broadly speaking, you could predict something happening in another room, sort of unseen, I suppose, uh that Foreknowledge would not allow you to affect. So,, what effect would that have? I think people would find it very disturbing. But then after they'd got over their sense of being disturbed, um uh which, by the way, I don't even think you need a machine to, to take this idea on board. But after they've got over that, they'd still understand that even though I have no free will and my actions are in effect, already determined. Um I still feel things, I still care about stuff. I remember my daughter saying to me, um uh she, she'd got hold of the idea that my view of the universe made it meaningless. And she said, well, then it's meaningless and I said, well, I can prove it's not meaningless because you mean something to me and I mean something to you. So it's not completely meaningless because there is a bit of meaning contained within this space. And so, a, uh, lack of free will space, you could think. Well, this robs me of everything I am. And then you'd say, well, no, it doesn't because you still like eating cheeseburgers and you still like going to see the movies. And so, so how big a difference does it really make? Um, but I think, I, I think initially people would find it very disturbing. I think, I think that what would come if you could really unlock with a determinism machine, everything, there'd be this wonderful wisdom that would come from it. And I'd rather have that than not."
