  "Text": "mean, it's a huge, it's a huge subject to talk about, I suppose. But, but one of the things I think is that humans are actually very experienced at creating new life forms, uh because that's why you and I are both here and it's why everyone on the planet is here. And so, so something in the process of having a living thing that exists that didn't exist previously is very much encoded into the structures of our life and the structures of our societies doesn't mean we always get it right. But it does mean we've learned quite a lot about that. We've learned quite a lot about what the dangers are of uh allowing things to be unchecked. And it's why we then create systems of checks and balances in our government. Um And, and so on and so forth. I mean, that's not to say, the, the other thing is, it seems like there's all sorts of things that you could put into a machine that you would not be. So with us, we, we sort of roughly try to give some rules to live by and some of us then live by those rules and some don't. And with a machine, it feels like you could enforce those things. So, partly because of our previous experience and partly because of the different nature of a machine, I just don't feel anxious about it. II I more I just see all the good that, you know, broadly speaking, the good that can come from it. Um But that, that's just my, that's just where I am on that anxiety spectrum,"
