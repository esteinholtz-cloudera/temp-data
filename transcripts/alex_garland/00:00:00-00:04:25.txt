  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Alex Garland, writer and director of many imaginative and philosophical films from the dreamlike exploration of human self destruction in the movie annihilation to the deep questions of consciousness and intelligence raised in the movie Ex Machina, which to me is one of the greatest movies in artificial intelligence ever made. releasing this podcast to coincide with the release of his new series called devs that will premiere this Thursday, March 5th on Hulu as part of FX on Hulu. explores many of the themes. This very podcast is about from quantum mechanics to artificial life, to simulation to the modern nature of power in the tech world. got a chance to watch a preview and loved it. The acting is great. Nick Offerman especially is incredible in it. The cinematography is beautiful and the philosophical and scientific ideas explored are profound. And for me as an engineer and scientist were just fun to see brought to life. For example, if you watch the trailer for the series carefully, see there's a programmer with a Russian accent, looking at a screen with Python like code on it that appears to be using a library that interfaces with a quantum computer. attention and technical detail on several levels is impressive. And one of the reasons I'm a big fan of how Alex weaves science and philosophy together in his work. Alex for me was unlikely, but it was life changing in ways I may only be able to articulate in a few years as meeting spot, many of Boston dynamics for the first time planted a seed of an idea in my mind. So did meeting Alex Garland. He's humble, curious, intelligent and to me, an inspiration. Plus, he's just really a fun person to talk with about the biggest possible questions in our universe. is the Artificial Intelligence podcast.

Let me mention that Cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating. I recommend a cent of money as a great book on this history, debits and credits on ledgers started 30,000 years ago. The US dollar was created about 200 years ago at Bitcoin. The first decentralized Cryptocurrency was released just over 10 years ago. given that history, Cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development, but it still is aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money. again, if you get Cash app from the App Store or Google Play and use Code Lex podcast, you'll get $10 and cash app will also donate $10 to the first one of my favorite organizations that is helping advance robotics and stem education for young people around the world. now here's my conversation with Alex Garland. describe the world inside the shimmer in the movie Annihilation as dreamlike in that it's internally consistent but detached from reality that leads me to ask. Do you think a philosophical question? I apologize. Do you think we might be living in a dream or in simulation? Like the kind that the shimmer creates human beings here today?"
