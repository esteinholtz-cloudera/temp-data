  "Text": ", I wanna sort of separate that out into two things., I think we're living in a dream of sorts., I don't think we're living in a simulation. I think we're living on a planet with a very thin layer of atmosphere and the planet is in a very space and the space is full of other planets and stars and quasars and stuff like that. And I don't think, I don't think those physical objects, I don't think the matter in that universe is simulated. I think it's there are. Definitely. Or a whole problem with saying definitely. But in my opinion, I'll just go about that. We, we, I, I think it, it seems very like we're living in a dream state. I'm pretty sure we are. And I, I think that's just to do with the nature of how we experience the world, we experience it in a subjective way. Uh And the, the thing I've learned most as I've got older in some respects is, the degree to which reality is counterintuitive and that the things that are presented to us as objective turn out not to be objective. And quantum mechanics is full of that kind of thing, but actually just day to day life is full of that kind of thing as well. So, my understanding of the way the way the brain works is you, you get some information to hit your optic nerve and then your brain makes its best guess about what it's seeing or what it's saying it's seeing, may or may not be an accurate best guess it might be an inaccurate, best guess. And that, that gap, the best guess gap means that we are essentially living in a subjective state, which means that we're in a dream state. So I and I, I think you could enlarge on the dream state in all sorts of ways. But so yes, dream state, no simulation would be where I'd come"
