  "Text": ", all I could say is that from my point of view, it's almost exactly the reverse because, see that pretty much everything I do is a reaction to what scientists are doing. I, I'm, I'm an interested layperson and, I feel, you know, this individual, I feel that the most interesting area that humans are involved in is science. I think art is very, very interesting, but the most interesting is science and is in a weird place because maybe around the time Newton was alive, if a very very interested layperson said to themselves, I want to really understand what Newton is saying about the way the world works. Um with a few years of dedicated thinking, they would be able to understand the, the sort of principles he was laying out and I don't think that's true anymore. I think that's stopped being true now. So I'm a pretty smart guy. And if I said to myself, I want to really, really understand uh what is the state of quantum mechanics or string theory or, or any of the sort of branching areas of it, I wouldn't be able to uh I'd be intellectually incapable of doing it because, because to, to work in those fields at the moment is a bit like being an athlete, I suspect you need to start when you're 12. You know, and if you, if you start in your mid twenties, start trying to understand it in your mid twenties, then you're, you're just never going to catch up. That's the way it feels to me., so what I do is I try to make myself open. So, so the people that you're implying, maybe I, I would influence I it it, to me, it's exactly the other way around. These people are strongly influencing me. I'm thinking they're doing something fascinating. I'm concentrating and working as hard as I can to try and understand the implications of what they say. And in some ways often what I'm trying to do is disseminate ideas um into a, a means by which it can enter uh a public conversation. So, so ex Machina contains lots of name checks, all sorts of existing thought experiments, you know, uh shadows on, you know, Plato's Cave and in the black and white room and all all all sorts of different long standing thought processes about sentience or consciousness or subjectivity or, or gender or whatever it happens to be. And then, and then I'm trying to marshal that into a narrative to say, look, this stuff is interesting and it's also relevant and this is my best shot at it. So, so I'm the one being influenced in my construction. That,"
