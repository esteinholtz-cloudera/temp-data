  "Text": ", there is, but there's a counterpoint as well, which is that most parents would wish for a better life for their Children. So there may be a regret about some things about the past, but broadly speaking, what people really want is that things will be better for the future generations, not worse And so, then it's a question about what constitutes a future generation.
