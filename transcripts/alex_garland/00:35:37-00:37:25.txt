  "Text": ", it's about the interior state and what constitutes the interior state and how do we know it's there? And actually in that respect, ex Machina is as much about in general it is to do specifically with machine consciousness. And it's also interesting, you know, that thing you started asking about the dream state. And I was saying, well, I think we're all in a dream state because we're all in a subjective state. Um One of the things that I became aware of with ex Machina is that the way in which people reacted to the film was very based on what they took into the film. many people thought ex ex machin was the, was the tale of a sort of evil robot who murders two men and escapes. And she has no empathy, for example, because she's a machine. Whereas I felt no, she was a conscious being with a consciousness different from mine. But so what imprisoned and made a bunch of value judgments about how get out of that box. And there, there's a moment which it sort of slightly bugs me, but nobody ever has noticed it and it's years after. So I might as well say it now, which is that after Ava has escaped, crosses a room and as she's crossing a room, this is just before she leaves the building, she looks over her shoulder and she smiles and I thought after all the conversation about tests in a way, the best indication you could have of the interior state of someone if they are not being observed and they smile about something with, they're smiling for themselves. And that to me was evidence of Ava's true sentience. Whatever that sentience was,"
