  "Text": "falling in love with cooking was about a, a solving a problem in my family. And it had to do with my mom feeling very anxious about cooking and overwhelmed frequently when it came to meals. And I'm naturally very good at juggling a lot of things. And it was just something I could dive in and help and help my dad very, very, very close to. So it was a very, it was a very functional role where I would see this kind of crescendo of anxiety um around meal times as a kid and be able to dive in and, and solve things. And I also loved women who cooked. Like my father's mother is a great cook. She was, I remember her telling me as a kid, you know, I was asking her about church and why she went to church. And she's like, I mostly go to church because I get to cook for the, the, you know, potlucks. And so there was a, there was an openness around that that but she just loved to cook for people. And it was, and there was a real tenderness and expression of that love. So seeing women in my life who had this like real tenderness and love that they shared through food and then also being able in my own home to kind of pick add value and help my mom and dad was really powerful for me because I felt like I had a superpower. You know, I felt like, oh man, I just made this stressful thing go away. That was huge."
