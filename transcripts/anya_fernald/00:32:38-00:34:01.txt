  "Text": "roast a couple of chickens and then I'll poach them like, I'll boil them and let it cool down. It's a complicated one. I'll let them cool down. I'll pull all the meat off, put the bones back into the pot and then cook that for like three or four hours and then add in like shitake mushrooms and the chicken meat and the, and I'll throw in a bottle of white wine into the, into the stock as well. A bunch of thyme and garlic. And I love it because it's, it's the way the house smells. It's very laborious. It's soothing for me to spend time picking apart meat and chopping things up. There's like a lot of manual around it., so I'd say from a personal, like, I mean, I love grilling a steak and doing those things as well. But there's something about making a stock from scratch and the way it smells, the way I feel the time it takes the kind of checking in on it that I really, really love. There's many things that I love to make that I don't even love to, to eat. You know, I think you see this a lot in like baking and bakers. People who bake and they love the process of it even if they don't eat that many baked goods. So anything for me that's really like enjoyable is typically things like making cinnamon buns. I don't eat very many cinnamon buns, but I love making them because it takes all the sort of like fussing around and taking your time and watching it the way it smells, the way the house smells. All of that stuff is like, it's like almost like a meditative exercise for me."
