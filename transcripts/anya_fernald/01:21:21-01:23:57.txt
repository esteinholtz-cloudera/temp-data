  "Text": "moved to Europe right after my early twenties and I worked as a cheese maker, and I lived in really small rural farms in the countryside and I got up early and milked animals made cheese. I got to live in a traditional agricultural society and learn how they ate. it shaped me as a cook because was chance to have incredible ingredients, learn how to cook. Very simple food. had been immersed in thought that I wanted to be like a chef, chef, right? Um because I love food and I love cooking and I, and I was just drawn to that world, but I don't like um the experience of that sort of like fancy food experience is not my not what, what is exciting for me about it. So I loved working in that environment because got to eat lunches and dinners and everything with the farm that I lived on and just very traditional simple way to eat. other piece of it is, you know, I went to high school in the nineties child of like the low fat fat generation, right? And it was just really liberating and amazing to eat tons of super fatty foods and um olive oil all over the place and bleak sides of bread and salami and being in this like vibrant health like be leaner, you know, happy, skin stuff, you know, stop getting split ends. Like I stopped having flaky nails, like just stuff that had bothered me my whole life, including like just moodiness and that all just changed. And granted, I was also like living on a farm in Italy and getting up with the sunlight and um like, there were lots of great aspects of my life as well that happened at that time. But I was just immersed in this diet that I realized like, man, this is so simple. And I also love that I had, you know, you'd have dinner and it was just like some ricotta cheese with some olive oil, some bread and like a bowl of fava beans like that's dinner. And it kind of broke down my assumptions too about like dinner always has to be this, you know, a protein and a vegetable and you know, being more fluid and more seasonal exciting for me. So I just learned kind of a lot about paying attention to food, simple preparation and vibrancy of health that I personally experienced kind of made me double down on that."
