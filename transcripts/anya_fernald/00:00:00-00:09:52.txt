  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Anya Fernald co-founder of Bell Camp of Farms that was founded with a purpose to create meat that's good for people the planet and the animals specifically treating their animals as ethically as possible. In this, she sought to revolutionize the meat industry from the inside out. also a scholar and practitioner of regenerative agriculture and she's a chef who has appeared many times as a judge on Iron Chef. Plus, she has one of my favorite food related Instagrams. On top of that. She's also a longtime friend of Andrew Huberman, which is how we first got connected. mention of our sponsors Gala Games, athletic Greens for Stigmatic and fun to check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that I got the chance to visit and spend a few days with Anya at Bel Camp of farms in northern California. I met many animals there from cows to pigs and saw the amazing land on which they grazed. butchered meat. I watched Anya cook many amazing meals. I ate raw meat and cooked meat and spent long hours at the bonfire, talking with friends and listening to the sounds of nature. hiked swam in a cold mountain lake and slept in a tent underneath the stars. It was an amazing eye opening experience, especially in my first ever visit to a slaughterhouse. term slaughterhouse is haunting in itself. The animals I met lived a great life, but in the end, they were slaughtered in the most ethical way possible but slaughtered. Nevertheless, seeing animals with whom just the day before I made a connection, be converted to meat that I then consumed. Was deeply honest to me, ethical farm be Campo represents less than 1% of animals raised in the United States. The rest is factory farmed. I could not escape the thought of the 40 to 50 billion animals worldwide raised in terrible conditions on these factory farms. spent most of my life thinking about and being in contact with human suffering. But the landscape of suffering in the minds of conscious beings is much larger than humans. must admit that I still am haunted by human suffering more than animal suffering. Perhaps I will one day see the wrong in me drawing such a line. way, the visit to Bell Campo farms made me realize that I have not thought deeply enough about the ethics of my choices and the choices of human civilization with respect to animals. And more importantly, I have not thought or learned enough about large scale solutions to alleviate animal suffering. Campo is paving the way on this and it is the reason I wanted to show my support for their and anya's efforts in regenerative farming and ethical treatment of animals. usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now. No ads in the middle. I think those get in the way of the conversation. I try to make these interesting but I give you time stamps. So if you skip, please still check out the sponsors by clicking the links in the description. It is the best way to support this podcast. I'm very picky about the sponsors we take on. So hopefully, if you buy their stuff, you get value out of it. Just as I have. Speaking of value, let's talk about games. show is sponsored by Gala Games. A fascinating new sponsor. They have created a gaming ecosystem on a Blockchain where in-game assets are NFTS that you can keep trade in the game and outside the game. They are attracting big game designers and uh I think have a real chance to revolutionize what it means to play video games since you can take items in one game and carry them outside of that game and over to another game, maybe a little version of that game. Once Diablo Four comes out, I definitely will play it. And the same is true for certain other games like Grand Theft Auto. If a new version ever comes out. And certainly if there's another version of elder scrolls, I'm all in and the idea that you can have items that you get in the game and there is a provable uniqueness through the process of NFTS to that item, such that you can take it out of the game, sell it to somebody else, or more importantly, keep it and carry it forward throughout your life. I mean, that makes game so much more immersive because it blends what it means to be in a virtual world versus the real world. That to me is fascinating and it gives so much more opportunity to design gaming experiences in the hands of like the best game designers in the world. So I'm very excited by the whole idea and and definitely by the scale and the intensity of effort from Gala games. I started playing the uh talent simulation game that they have called Talent Star. I created a very creatively named town called Lexington started building stuff. I loved it. If you want to join me in the game, you're welcome to. I wish I had more time to play video games. Honestly, it brings me so much joy. Anyway, check out Gala dot game slash LEX. That's Gala dot Games slash LEX. This show is sponsored by athletic greens, the all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance. It replaced the multivitamin for me and went far beyond that with 75 vitamins and minerals. It's the thing I drink every day. I break the fast of it and I usually drink twice a day and they have all these iterations. They have all these versions. It's almost like a software on github with releases. And I think they have a new version coming out. It's basically the same exact drink and they just keep iterating on improving and improving based on the current science of nutrition. And the funny thing is this is basically all they do is this one drink. They also have fish oil and I think you get one month's supply of oil for free once you sign up. So that's another thing I take is uh fish oil. So it's electrolytes, fish oil and athletic greens for all the nutrition and the vitamins, it tastes great. It's refreshing and it just uh ensures that I get the nutritional base for all the other crazy dietary things I choose to partake in including fasting. So athletic greens is definitely one of my favorite sponsors. Uh You should go sign up now to uh athletic greens.com/let. athletic greens.com/lex for the drink and the fish oil. Trust me, it's awesome. This show is sponsored by, for Sigma, the maker of delicious mushroom coffee and plant based protein. I start the day every day with their coffee. I don't know if it's the caffeine or the smell of coffee or just the warm drink. There's something once I drink that first cup of coffee. It's the meme, the cliche thing. But my mind just turns on and it's focus those first couple of hours in the day of deep focus and productivity are just incredible. And I feel like the routine of that is essential. And for me, I think for millions of people, coffee is a big part of that routine. On top of that, there's a bunch of stuff with force stigmatic that makes it healthy. You should go check it out. But to me, the important thing is that it's delicious and it doesn't taste like mushrooms in case you were wondering, I have a lot of fond memories about gathering in the woods with my grandmother. That was a big uh Soviet. That was a big Russian thing to do. I thought of her as like the greatest botanist in the world since there's so many mushrooms or at least I thought there's so many mushrooms that could kill you and she always knew which ones are good for you, which are not and we would make soup with them. So I have a soft spot in my heart for mushrooms. Maybe that's also why I like Formatic. Get up to 40% off and free shipping and mushroom coffee bundles. If you go to formatic.com/lex, for sigma.com/lex. This episode is also sponsored by Fundrise spelled F Un Drise. It's a platform that allows you to invest in private real estate, if you're looking to diversify your investment portfolio. This is a good choice. I still believe you should diversify across all kinds of assets. Private real estate is a fascinating one on top of stuff you might be doing mutual funds or anything you're doing in Cryptocurrency. In fact, there's been quite an increase in inflation recently and I've been listening to a bunch of economists sort of try to dissect what that means. And I've been a little bit surprised that an increase in inflation has not been as far as I can tell. Coupled with increased prices for Cryptocurrency, saw crypto as a hedge against inflation. Of course, nobody really understands how the hell this whole complicated stock market, Cryptocurrency market, all of those things work how the economy works. It is such a fascinating, infinitely complex game theoretic process that involves millions of humans in that mess and chaos of a process. I think diversification is still very powerful. so you should definitely check out Fundrise at fundrise.com/lex, 100 and 50,000 investors use it. It takes just a few minutes to get started at fundrise.com/lex F un Drise fundrise.com/lex. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Anya Fernald, you're watching the video version of this are asking yourself why we're in nature right now. There's actually a beautiful mountain in the background. an incredible vast landscape, there's a farm. sitting behind a table. And nevertheless, I'm wearing a suit and tie uh amidst nature. We're at the beautiful Bell Campo Farms. We're going to talk about that, this incredible place you have here. But you cook some meat yesterday. It tasted delicious. So I'd love to talk about just the, the science and art of cooking. First. as a chef. When you think of cooking, is it a science or is it an art,"
