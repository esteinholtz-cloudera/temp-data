  "Text": "a tough one because there's lots of layers around kind of gender roles and families changing and things I'd say. I agree around the alienation and I've done carnivore diet and I've tried some of these extreme protocols and I too, I suffered from loneliness. You know, it was like doing carnivore and, not being able to eat what my kids and talk about at the same time that those pieces are real and I wonder with all of these diets, that structure is actually helping or just taking away from people's kind of sensual understanding. Um But I think that there's some rigor around that, that helps people discover what's good for them by eliminating. And then growing towards more intuitive food is a good evolution from that base. I love to cook for people. I love to pay attention to their, way of being and read what they'd like to eat. And it's my, my purest way of love that's for everybody in my life. I actually love to cook for people. I love, you know, I don't II I would have struggled to be, you know, putting out food all the time. It's like something for me, it's a real act of caretaking. So I definitely have that in my makeup. Um And, and I definitely notice um in times of like of, of real stress, that's the piece that drops off, right? And then, and it's like if I'm unable to care for myself, I have a hard time cooking. it's for me, it's very emotional, it's very connected to love"
