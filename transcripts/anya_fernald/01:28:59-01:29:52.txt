  "Text": "it out when I was learning as an apprentice cheese maker in Greece. one of the best meals of my life is like a bowl of cold sheep milk yogurt with like a crust of cold fat on top. So like the way that these fatty, you know, sheep milk can have double the percentage of fat than cow milk. So like there's a yogurt and then there's this crust of fat and then they pour the fresh honey over the top and you just eat like this bowl of probably top five meals of my life. Right. I mean, and it just, that's the simplicity of just the best thing and it was the fact that it's in Terracotta and I'd had this amazing day and, know, all of these things come together. But I still remember that feeling and I think most of us have those like, really great sensual memories of food and they're not about necessarily that one fancy over the top restaurant or something. It's really about the whole context of enjoyment."
