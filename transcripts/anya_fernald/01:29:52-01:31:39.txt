  "Text": "you can help me with something. Uh So we, I think offline said that we're both introverts a bit, but I certainly joy in repetition. So I kind of hide away as an introvert and eat the same thing over and over and over again. at the same time, I had this conversation with uh Tyler Cohen, who's an economist, but he's also a food critic. He writes these incredible posts about different foods. And we had this conversation about what his last meal would be if he had to choose like, what is the best meal he's ever eaten that he would want to eat. he had a good answer about it. It had to do with experience, I think for him, it was a particular Mexican restaurant and it had in Mexico because of the ingredients because of the experience because of the work it took to get there and all those kinds of things. But it also made me realize, like, when I was going home after that conversation that couldn't answer that question myself, like, what is the best meal I've ever eaten? Because I really haven't experienced much. so it almost was like a challenge to myself. Like I feel like I should journey out a little bit more in this life and try stuff to try to see like, what is the best meal for me in the world? know, like both the experience and the taste, right? So I was kind of wondering first, I'd love to ask you what your last meal would be or what is the greatest meal you've ever eaten? But also, and you're still very young and so the life there's still more experiences to be had, right? And for me, like, how do you go about finding the best meal in the world?, is there you could give? Essentially"
