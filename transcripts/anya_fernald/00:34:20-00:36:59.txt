  "Text": "the basic approach to cooking any type of meat? the artistry of it is pretty scientific and it's type of muscle is it in the animal? what's the surface area to volume ratio?, so let's look at those two questions. So the first piece is, what's the type of muscle in the animal? What's the functionality? You don't necessarily need to know that um to evaluate it, but you need to understand, is it a tender muscle that's not used very frequently in the animal or is it a big load bearing muscle that gets a lot of action like cheek, right? Or the shin or the those pieces, muscles like um those along the spinal cord that make up rib eyes in New York steaks and things, those aren't very exercised. They're, they're right next to the spinal cord. Spinal cord is doing most of the work there. They're kind of like um, stabilizing muscles around this big functional piece of, of skeletal structure in the animal. muscles like the ones around the diaphragm with the flat iron steaks and skirt steaks and things. Those are, those are really functional muscles that are doing a ton and moving and they, if they're moving a lot, what happens? Well, functionally, they've got lots of muscle sheaths because muscles that move frequently have to do a lot of like complex contraction. That's why, you know, there's um, in the cheek, for example, there's tons of visible fiber of like collages, connective tissue connective tissue is everything in how the meat cooks because connective tissue doesn't respond to high heat with becoming more tender muscles do, right. They can get a sear on them, you can cut them and eat them. The coag tissue will glom up and get really tough. So you either have to liquefy it with really low, slow heat, with moisture, right? Um, or you have to barely cook it. And, so that's the major piece. So that's the question of like, why wouldn't you just throw a brisket on the grill? Ok. It's not about the fat. You can cut the fat out. The reason you're not going to throw a brisket on the grill and cook it hot and fast is it's got too much collages, connective tissue in it. Those are these giant muscles that have all this collagen and these fibers and tendons in them effectively. So you're never going to be able to just cook that up hot fast. So that's the first piece. It's like, what, where's this muscle in the architecture of the animal? And then what does that mean for what's going on in the muscle? that's actually more important than fat content. We get really kind of, we pay a lot of attention to fat content in muscles. You can make a steak tender if it doesn't have a ton of fat in it, it actually has more to do with, if there's, if there's collages and connective tissue in it."
