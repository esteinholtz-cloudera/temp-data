  "Text": "something that I'm glad you bring up because it's an element that with eating so many of our meals like out of a bag. And know, the the instance where you start to eat the meals when the delivery shows up and you might smell something when you open the bag, right? And no judgment on that, that's something I do too, right? But that does take away a whole element of, of surprise and delight. And also I think of your body's ability to prepare for it. You know, you think about our most common memories of childhood, for those of us who grew up in homes with, with parents who cooked is smell of things, cooking and it's not the eating of it. It's the smell of things, cooking. So why is that so memorable? an anticipatory piece of food. That's what you remember about your experiences of food is the moment of like sweet anticipation of some of this great sensual experience that's going to be really gratifying on these emotional and physical levels. So I think we're also resonating on those memories because it's like, it's an experience of food where the sensuality of it is kind of extended. it's a long kind of arc of build up and then you're eating it and it's amazing and then you're enjoying it and your body feels good. So all those pieces together, it's a much more memorable experience than just grabbing the cookie out of a bag, right? So look at our own and just revisit in your mind like the memories of food, the most compelling ones, it's the smell and then the experience and then sometimes how one felt. Right?"
