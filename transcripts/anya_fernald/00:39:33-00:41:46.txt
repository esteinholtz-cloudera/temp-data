  "Text": "indirect heat and direct heat and that really is mostly about temperature in more than actual, I mean, smoke is important as well that can permeate. But really, the smoke doesn't go into the center of most cuts that you barbecue. It'll come in like the smoke ring. It's, it's a, it's a, know, it's maximum, like half an inch on the outside, maybe a little bit deeper on a really long slow cook. So they, but the, the smoke that does create a ton of flavor on the surface of the meat. Um But that's so the indirect allows you to have smoke contacting it and then a very, very low and slow heat. And what that does is indirect heat will be low and slow enough that the center of the meat will get warm at the same time as the exterior of the meat and it'll all cook equally all get equally tender. you go very hot and fast, you risk the interior of the meat not getting right, you kind of create a shell on the, on it. Um And you slow down the interior of the meat, which you actually want to do with something like a steak or you want to keep it rare on the inside. So it's really indirect versus direct. Then once you get into direct heat, right? Like in that category, there's wood, charcoal gas, right? That's about it. And those are meaningfully different, meaningfully different. Charcoal and wood, that's more of, there's more poetry and wood there's a little bit more flavor, not functionally, very different, but gas versus charcoal wood is very different. Um, and that's because of the actual scent of the, of the cook, right? The scent of the flavor. Um, and then there's a, I think an evenness of heat distribution that comes off of charcoal different from gas because no matter how awesome your gas grill is, you do have hotter and cooler spots. So gas grills are typically you can kind of control for that if you just are going really hot and fast, which is why gas grills are fine if you're just like throwing that steak on, getting a hard sear on those burgers, put a crust on it. That's fabulous for that. It's perfect you're doing things that do better with a low and slow cook. Um, like, let's say a whole tenderloin or chicken thigh that's going to be a little bit less elegant on gas than on charcoal versus wood. So when you have more, more kind of nuance in the low slow cook over the natural fuels,"
