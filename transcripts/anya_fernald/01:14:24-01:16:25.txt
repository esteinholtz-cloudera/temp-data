  "Text": "case. Omega Sixes are a big part of that. In the case of the, you eat a lot of beef, you love beef. And so in a conventional beef product, it's a 1 to 30 ratio of Omega threes to sixes and it can sometimes 1 to 21 to 30 but that's the wrong direction. our beef, it's, you know, as low as 1 to 1. So that and the Omega sixes are what's part of inflammation now. You know, they, the magic in animals is that they're incredibly efficient processors, right? And in the same way that, you know, the, the, the body can protect uh from, you know, can process and take out tons of things that are toxic out of the environment. I mean, animals bodies can do that too. So the beauty of meat is that it can be pretty clean, you know, things like round up and stuff don't end up in the meat when we have antibiotics in our meat. We're not worried about getting like tetra from the chicken breast. we're worried about is the workers getting t recycling the chicken growing faster than it should. The meat being chewier and not as high quality. So that, but the actual antibiotics don't the animals great at filtering that right. They get that out. So you have to think about meat, not as like contamination of like, oh there's going to be some of that garbage they used in the farming in my meat. Um but it's the more subtle things, it's the fat ratio, it's the protein density. And there's also, uh just, think in my experience, um, there's just more complex flavor and things that taste more complex. This is, you know, science backs this up. They, they fill you up faster. So if you're looking to limit, you know, to, to eat for fullness and, but not eat as many calories, more complex foods are the way to do that and that hit, know, you hit your satiety, it'll help you hit that satiety. So things like, I mean, all the key um you know, amino acids that help you feel full mostly from meat, right? Um So those are, that's part of it like, but all meats have those, then there's other kind of micronutrients and things around that complex flavor that help you feel full faster."
