  "Text": "think fasting is gaining in popularity because we're having to relearn the importance of being hungry in anticipation and delight. We have such a fear of hunger. Um And that's really, you know, functional in evolution, right? But we have this deep fear of hunger. And part of the Great American experience has been that we don't have to be afraid of hunger at all because there's food everywhere and it's really cheap in all that abundance. We've lost edge of hunger and we don't let ourselves get hungry. And that's one thing that I learned in part of my journey as a cook and chef has been, you know, moving abroad was the first time when I lived out of the US was the first time that I regularly experienced hunger because the time between meals was really long and was just what everybody did. And so I was hungry for two hours before lunch and that was the first time in my life that there hadn't just been readily available snacks. So I I wonder if they the intermittent fasting and part of the popularity around it, it I'm sure there's all these amazing metabolic things that are happening. But also people might also feel better because they're really anticipating and enjoying food. Then if you look at the feelings of fullness, there's a really interesting thing that happens when you cook your sense of fullness, which is if you cook and you're hungry, the experience of being around the food, smelling it, touching it, sampling it, you'll take your hunger down by 40%. this is my own observation. But as I mean, we've all had the experience of cooking Thanksgiving and the cook never kind of wants to eat that much Thanksgiving. That's an extreme experience. But when you really dive in and you're cooking for a few hours and you're smelling and smelling and smelling, it totally changes your threshold of satiety and fullness because of other sensory things that are happening. And for those of us looking to, you know, to maintain weight and something to consider in this is that cooking is also of the part of what your appetite when you're hungry. What are you hungry for? Right. So we tend to think about calories, but when you're hungry, you might also be hungrier for a wider range of things and it might be smells, it might be stopping, there's other elements and that's something I think as a cook that it's, it's powerful to explore and be with and observe how your hunger changes when you're cooking."
