  "Text": "mission, you know, and it's in the joy of it and the part where it's gotten fun for me has been returning to what I love about it and I've only had the privilege of doing that pretty recently. Um, so I think for me personally, you know, starting, I hostess these events on the farm called Meat Camps where I cook and teach people to cook and, you know, taste and talk about flavor and all the like sensual aspects of it that I, that are my fire. Like, thank goodness I did that stuff because otherwise it was just such a beating, you know, so there are parts of it where I got to feed my fire. Um And then now in the, you know, the past year since resigning, I've been, I do all the recipe development. I shoot all the content., you know, taste product. I'm developing all of our new products. I launched our meatballs. I'm just about to launch our chicken meatballs doing a high protein bone broth like those are, that's what why I did this was to be able to build this great product that I could build on. So I'm kind of at that place now, but it's taken a lot longer. And I think, you know, looking at the landscape of what to do in food, this is definitely tackled the most complicated problem. I can imagine, you know, I did it like in the most old fashioned way. Right. So it's been super complex and then I also look at it and I'm like, yeah, and it's been messy and it's going to continue to be hard. But I'm proud of having tackled the hard problems."
