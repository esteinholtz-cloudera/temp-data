  "Text": "think you have to decide on a palette. You know, if we're talking about an art, it's equivalent to saying, am I a sculptor or painter that the sushi lexicon think that's a very, very narrow, small canvas that you're painting on and that is a beautiful road. Right? There's, there's a, there's a beauty and a perfection to that. It's like, I mean, there's many things culturally around that, that you could extrapolate for specifically for Japan. II, I encourage people on in the journey in food to choose like kind of a language that they're working within. And if you want to step out of that occasionally and have one or two dishes, but if you want to get mastery with food, you probably aren't going to be able to get more than say 20 ingredients that you use regularly that you really understand. And so we often see, you know, I see the American pantry, it's got tons of sauces and tons of spices and tons of spice blends. then really people only use just a couple of things and the idea that you can sort of splash out and do Korean one night and then tacos the next night, you can absolutely. But to get in a regular cadence of specific ingredients, you're probably going to get more mastery with that sooner. I think as much as you can do to get an understanding of the, you know, the basics around salt and acid and understand your palate. For me, it's lemon and usually sherry vinegar, right? So that's my acid palate. Um, and I my fat palates, you know, sue it in butter, olive oil. So you can sort of choose your language what you're painting with. Um, but I wouldn't splash out and say, do I use sesame oil? Yeah, every once in a while. But that's not part of my base palate, right?"
