  "Text": "individualistic. So like focused on the particular individual, it's almost like uh a journey of understanding what that person is excited about in the, in the landscape of flavors, like figuring that person out what they like, what they, what they love to eat. Yeah, see cooking. I mostly cook for myself. So I see that as almost a, this is going to be the worst term but like an act of self love, this is going to be clipped out that it's almost an exploration of what brings me joy. it's surprising because I usually don't share because the things that bring me joy are the simplest ingredients. Like I'm one of those people, don't know if you can psychoanalyze me because you also like basic ingredients. I like a single ingredient to ingredients because I feel like I can deeply appreciate the particular ingredient. Then I get easily distracted. know, people who are really good at listening to music, they can hear a piece of music and in their mind, extract the different layers and enjoy different layers at a time. Like the bass, the drums, the different layering of the piano, the beats and all that kind of stuff. That's what it means to truly enjoy music, to listen to a piece over and over. Like almost like as a scholar in that same way for food, I just can't do more than like three because then it's just, I have to give in to the chaos of it, I guess. But when it's just the basic ingredient, like just meat we just the vegetable like basic grilled without sauces without any of that I've discovered is what brings me a lot of joy, but that's boring to a lot of people. So I usually have to be kind of private about that joy. So, but that's mine. So I figured that out, I guess as a chef, you have to figure that out about everybody that you care for."
