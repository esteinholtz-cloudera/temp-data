  "Text": "also in traditional ag you don't have inputs that are very convenient. You can put some chicken manure on but you can't spray or dump something that massively increases the growing potential of the land was not available until the past 60 years., regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming where you're increasing soil fertility through your farming, increase soil fertility by feeding the soil, feed the soil carbon. why regenerative farming is better for the environment. It sequester carbon and puts carbon into the soil., it's interesting plants need carbon and put it into the soil when they're going through growth. if you have a beautiful field of grass, that's just waving in the wind, that's not sequestering as much carbon as plants that have been damaged and are regrowing that have been damaged and are regrowing, are repairing. And they're doing that by drawing down carbon as one of the nutrients that feeds them to damage the plants effectively. That's what we're doing with regenerative grazing. the cows or, you know, lambs or whatever out there, they're eating and taking the grass down and that then cause a regrowth cycle that sequesters carbon, there's a limit to it. There's an edge because if those plants are so damaged that they can't regrow, then it turns into a dirt patch and that doesn't sequester any carbon. So it's a balance."
