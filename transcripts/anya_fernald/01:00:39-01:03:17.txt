  "Text": "that's pretty simple. You can look at the physiology of the animal and figure that out., ruminant species are lamb goats and beef and they have five stomachs. They're, they evolved, eating really low calorie, high fiber foods. That's why they've got all the stomachs. They need a lot of processing you or I were to eat grass. We die in a week. Right. We, we, our physiology can't handle it. Cows were built and evolved to eat this very low calorie, very high fiber, very low density food and they walk around slowly. They're moving constantly and they're eating it we put them on a corn fed diet. That's the opposite of their evolutionary diet and their systems really struggle with it. Now, pigs and chickens are different. Pigs and chickens are omnivores pigs will happily eat. For example, our pigs on the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes and eat them. Um, you know, it's, they, they, they, they, they enjoy all of it. They, they're omnivores so that you often see, and I've seen people try to raise like a grass fed chicken and that doesn't exist. I mean, they need a higher omnivores eat everything. They're what's called mono GST. They got one stomach and that one stomach needs higher density nutrients., in the case of, um, chicken, if you're to do, you know, look back in American history and in the 19 fifties, it took, you know, commercial chickens took like 54 weeks to come to full weight now it's 2.5 weeks in the in confinement farming on our, in our systems. It's like 8 to 10 weeks typically. it's a very, you have to give them some amount of nutrient density. Um, but there's a, the idea that no grain because you, that's a misinformation for any type of commercial operation, free range, regenerative pastured, everything. You're going to have to have a grain feed to get any type of. It's actually, I think for the case of chickens, unless you're in a place with like tons of natural seeds and grubs and worms and stuff to eat really challenging for the chicken. So you, you got to give them some high density, high calorie food different from that. That's an evolutionary diet a really key thing. That's the fundamental thing for health. And it's also interesting because that the evolutionary diet ties to human health. I've looked at the nutritional analysis on, on all of our products and it's the evolutionary diet is for the case of beef and lamb gets their omega 3 to 6 ratios the same as wild game. it's not like beef is really radically different from elk, a ruminant species, right? If you feed beef and evolutionary diet, their nutritional profile is the same as wild meat. There's a wild ruminant."
