  "Text": "really key with the wood fire. So when we evolved um from cooking over wood to charcoal, right? When, when that became more popular, the reason that we did that is that allowed us to skip the whole part of making our own charcoal. Right. So when you're cooking over wood, all you're doing is making your own charcoal. don't ever cook over wood with the red fire. Like we don't like, throw a steak on when the flames are orange and leaping up because you're just going to get, you know, carbons like char all over your meat. So you're, when you're cooking over wood, you first cook down the wood, you create the coal base, the natural coal base and then you cook over that. So you saw yesterday, I built my fire, I let it burn down. I added some fresh wood so I could reinforce my coals with new coals coming in. But then I was actually cooking over the embers. shorten that cycle with carbon with, with, with charcoal, it's more, it's more efficient. what you lose is that whole cycle of, you know, that really beautiful experience of smelling. Now, if you're cooking on a Trager, you're gonna get awesome smoke smell. You know, like you're, there's plenty of ways to do this. It doesn't always have to be wood fire. And I love all the different ways, right? But I, I really like the experience of the campfire and I love that kind of just like sitting by it, building it. Having to take the time. I like building the fire going inside, preparing all my meats, bringing them out, cooking them whole experience start to finish is really just like something that it's my favorite. It's my favorite way to spend it, spend time, you know. So I think, and, and why is that, is the food that different than cooking it in a, in a more conventional grill? Probably not, you know, like in a pure experience. But I think the actual experience is super memorable because you are outside, you are slow in your role, you're enjoying the this, you know, you're just taking in, you're watching, you're anticipating. I love that whole experience."
