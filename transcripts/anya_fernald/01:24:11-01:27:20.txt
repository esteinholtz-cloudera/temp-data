  "Text": "enough in the rearview mirror. I mean, I was hired by this group in Sicily on and this is, know, I was all of like 21 years old and to get a permit to work there, you have to show that you have a competency that nobody else in Italy has. And that competency for Anya Fernald at the time was cheese expert. So it was like this like stupid American girl being like going to the consulate. So I already knew that it was like there was something wobbly about this organization, but um I went to work for them and um my boss from that time end up in federal prison for corruption. Um Many years later, um embezzlement primarily. But so I, I was definitely in an environment that was um answering to multiple masters and to put it, it was, it was, I couldn't have asked for a better way to, to kind of get with life and understand how things happen in the world though. You know, it of learning as somebody who tends to be super direct and not very subtle. It was amazing to be in this world where like everybody communicates in multiple levels. Like my, we're going to lunch with my boss with somebody we're gonna do a business deal with. And by the, the they ordered a glass of wine and with that order communicated like because that the father of the person who had made that wine had offended that other guy and like that level of stuff like, like nothing happened directly. I'm like, what are we talking about? Afterwards. I'm like, what happened at lunch? It's like, oh, I just, you know, I told him this by ordering that whatever, you know, that kind of thing. And so understand that there's different ways of communicating., but it was also, you know, it, it was interesting to see and I think, I, you know, it's kind of the struggle that I've lived again and again in my life. Fundamentally, what we were doing in that operation was there's a very traditional cheese called the Razzano cheese in Southeastern Sicily where I lived Raza. And um it was about scaling that operation. So it was European Union money that my boss was also unfortunately using for other things. But fundamentally, it was to take that type of very small scale cheese, get them exported, help them scale. And we did it and it was really challenging and I learned a lot about the safety issues and collaboration issues and creating groups of farmers for scale. So it's kind of been doing the same thing again and again. Um But Sicily, it, it, you know, it was also just the first place where I would regularly forage for food. You know, like there, I'd go to friends' houses and like go out and pick nettles or go out and pick wild asparagus. So every season there was stuff that you would be gathering and that was just part of how you lived and it was part of your health. So that was, I just learned a ton in that time about like simple eating and, and, and, and really healthy food, the simpler it is better, right? Like this sort of sense that healthy food isn't in a tiny package, granola bar, lots of labels, lots of powders. It's like the more simple, essential closer the land can actually lead to optimal health. You've learned"
