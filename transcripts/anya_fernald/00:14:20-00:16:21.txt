So like it's all tied in together, whether it's family or people close to you or even if it's just chefs, there's something about the personality of the human involved in making the food that kind of sticks with you in the memory. And for me, I recently did a 72 hour fast and there's a kind of sadness after you eat that it's over. I think the most delicious part was the, I went to the grocery store and just actually walking around looking at food with like everything looked delicious. Even like the crappiest stuff looked delicious. And I missed that. I really enjoyed that anticipation. And then I picked out the meal, I went home and I cooked it and the whole thing took, I don't know, maybe 23 hours, like the whole process. And that was the most delicious part. And the first taste, of course. And then, after it was over, there's a bit of a sadness because the part I remember is the build up the anticipation and then once you eat, it's over, we kind of focus on the destination, but it's the whole journey, the whole like even if you go to a restaurant, it's the conversations leading up to the meal and the first taste of the meal. That's where the joy is. if you get to watch the making of that meal, that's incredible. That's where the smell, the visual, how the ingredients come together. And especially as we were looking over the fire, watching it, the fire play with the raw meat and over time bring out the colors, bring out the, I don't know, you can visually associate the flavor. You know how it becomes a little bit of burnt on the outside. It has a crispiness to it. It starts to gain that crispiness and immediately your past memories of the delicious crispiness of various foods. You've eaten are somehow mapped into your immediately you start to taste it visually. I don't know. Yeah, that experience is magical. It's, and of, of course, maybe it's the Russian thing. But I'm almost like saddened when it's over."
