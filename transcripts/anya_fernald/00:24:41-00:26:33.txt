  "Text": ", also for you, very interested in things and, interested in things being done well and appreciating them. So the single ingredient also allows you to control for perfection and cooking that which is probably really appealing to you. Um And I think sometimes I see people also in the beginning of their journey of culinary trying to do too many things, right? So there's another piece too that you'll notice if you recall last night, I grilled us the salad, right? And then I did all those pieces separately that's something in general to be really attentive of when you're building flavor to make sure you pay attention to every piece separately. Um You know, the idea that you can OK with a soup or something or stew, there's, there's workarounds but like to make a great dish that's got four or five vegetables in it, cook them all separately to their optimal deliciousness and then combine them. that's another way to approach that is that you may also be able to look at the different ingredients separately and still have that sense of like understanding of it. But there's too often that we're layering together like four or five things and then cooking them all at once and then surprise that it's not delicious because you can't, you can't really optimize on multiple variables at the same time for peak awesomeness. And that's actually, you know, the, the number one way you see this is roasting a whole chicken which is difficult. It's the simplest dish, but it's very difficult because you have the breast meat, which is bigger chunks. They cook faster, you have the thighs and drums which are smaller and they cook slower to optimize that and pay attention to it and do it all right there, you're actually solving for different outcomes. So there's a, there's one example, but oftentimes food is less delicious with multiple ingredients at the start because we're not able to pay attention to how each one needs to end up. there's a way to parse that apart and achieve a better outcome."
