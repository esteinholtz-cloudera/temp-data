  "Text": ". 100% pro hunting. Um, I think the reason that hunting flips a switch for so many people is because it's the first thing they've had clean meat in their lives.. So I think that the hunter's journey when people get so turned on by hunting, they're just like, oh my God, I'm never going back. I'm saying that's great. If you got access to that, if you know the guy who'll give you the backstrap, awesome. But like you, that's not very, that's not achievable for most of us. Um And I do think that talking to hunters about their experiences, what they about it, many of them are just outdoors when I say that because most of them are men, but most of them love the outdoors aspect of it and being out in the wild. Um But a lot of them, it's because of how they feel when they eat the meat. And it's because they're eating, I mean, 99% of meat in America is made a very specific way and it's in a, in a way that is pretty inflammatory, not incredibly delicious. And when you're on that extreme, um and then you toggle to having this totally different style of product, feels radically different in your body. So of course, you're like, I'll never go back. So when I talk about us being on that spectrum. It's like, well, it's hunted meets it. I mean, I can never on any commercial operation create the variety of the biodiversity of species that an elk gets when it's around of his own. I mean, I can, there's no way you can do that on a farm. So there's always going to be that extra five or 10% that those wild animals are going to have. You know, and those wild animals also fast for longer. So they go through periods of starvation and that creates an even like slower growth for musculature, that's gonna be create even more unique flavor and characteristics. And so that's why there is that, that extra in the hunted meat. you can come a lot closer with regenerative traditional farming to that flavor and health um than with any other type of farming. I know. So that's where I see it on the spectrum. I love that people are getting excited about, about game because it's all, it's better for your health. It's got all the same characteristics as regenerative farm meat and it gets people turned on to like simple delicious food. know, you shouldn't have to cover food with that's got corn syrup and soy, a bunch of junk in it to make it palatable. you gotta put sauce on your food, you need to look at your ingredients, you need to revisit what you're starting from because if you have to put a bunch of things to mask flavor onto anything you're eating. You're trying to basically fool your palate into doing what's not best for your body. We're trying to, to tell our palates like just make it through this plate so you can get the calories in and we're masking the fact that we don't actually find it very appetizing. So we're kind of teaching ourselves to overcome our instinct food. saying there's this kind of bland based substrate, not very interesting. I'm not like sparking to it. Awesome. Put sugar and salt on it. This up the hyper processed flavor profile. Great done and then you're sparked to it. That's not, that's a very short road. And that's, I think a lot of the health problems we have now is because we're masking flavors and, and basically trying to get ourselves to move down this path of the same way we behave around all hyper processed foods. And that gets us into a mess with our health. if we can get things like game where people love the flavor out of the gate, but it's natural, simple, minimally processed, that's a win."
