  "Text": ". You might also be responding to that. It's a complex flavor. So there's also, there's an analogous, you know, if you look at butter for example, a lot of the butter that we eat in the US is just sweet cream butter. It's not cultured. If you explore like a cultured, fermented butter, maybe a grass, milk, grass fed and finished butter, you're going to get a ton more complexity. so you may also just be responding to having fats with more flavor, which is the the journey in the US has been towards refined foods that are very neutral and then you have to combine more of them to make things taste like things. so if you're coming from a background of using mostly just generic butter or let's say canola oil to cook with, those are very neutral oils. So you can also take some of your favorite fats and look for versions of them that are more flavorful. I mean, I love olive oil as a treat in a spoon like a good California extra version olive oil, I'll just like have it. I'll eat a piece of butter as a treat that's like or butter with salt on it. Like good fats can all of them can be if they're minimally processed and they're so delicious, right? But there are things that you have to like look for a version of them that's got that full palate of flavor. Well,"
