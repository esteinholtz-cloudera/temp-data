  "Text": "the fat will make the flavor more delicious, right? Like it'll add unctuousness and mouth feel and things like that. But all the connective tissue in meat and in some of the cuts like that, we ate a skirt steak last night. You could see a web of that collagen sheath on the outside, on a rib eye. That same collagen sheath is this big. There's only one, it goes around the outside. OK? Because that's just that muscle, there's one large muscle fiber. that specific, it's a myelin sheath, right? That that material needs moisture and low and slow heat to become tender. The other side of that is that when it becomes tender, it liquefies and it adds all this beautiful gelatinous consistency. That's what bone broth is. That's why like a a slow cooked pork shoulder is so delicious. It's not that it's full of all that fat. That fat is also great. But a lot of that mouth feel comes from that really beautiful dissolved collagen. when you're looking at like, how do I understand how I'm going to cook a piece of meat? That first fork in the road is, how is this going to respond to heat? And what's the appropriate cooking technique. the second piece is that surface area to volume ratio. And that's important because the heat is going to impact the meat through the surfaces of the meat that are in contact with the heat. if I have a steak that's three inches thick, gonna cook it extremely diff differently from a, from a steak that's AAA, half inch thick or three quarters of an inch thick. And that's the major of, and that's the truth. If I have a, a piece of pork shoulder that's cut into cubes versus having a whole pork shoulder that serves area to volume ratio, that's gonna totally change how I cook it. same things like pot roast and a beef stew would be the same cut of meat, right? But how I cook them is going to change based on the surface area to volume because you've got to let moisture and heat work its way into the center of the meat. And that's going to be determined by the amount of, the meat that's in contact with whatever cooking liquid or heat you've got."
