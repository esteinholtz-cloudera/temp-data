  "Text": "beef has been on grass its entire life and you want to look for the words, 100% grass fed or grass fed and finished. Now, the challenge with beef grass its whole life is that it gains weight more slowly. beef didn't evolve, eating corn and things, um it can eat them and in eating them, it gains weight more rapidly and has a version of like an an inflammatory response. If you actually look inside the room and of the animal inside the stomach, it's like black and shiny inside. Compared to grass fed animals, like green, smells like compost. So the animals themselves or whole physiology is, is damaged by that food, but they also gain weight really quickly and they put on a lot of fats, like if you or me were to eat a bunch of processed food compared to eating a bunch of greens, it's the same impact you're going to blow up. the problem for grass fed is getting the animals to gain weight, they're getting a ton of exercise, they're eating really clean, right? And they're super chill. So that's different from the animals that are kept still eating really nutrient dense foods and under a ton of stress, which is a confinement animal. are all grass fed meats created the same, the diet. Yeah, nutritional profile broadly. But the length of time that the animal lives is extremely important for the flavor of the meat. taking our beef to 24 to 26 months. Conventional is around 18 months. I'm always looking, you know, if you're evaluating grass fed animals, you want to get animals that are typically, uh allowed to live for longer because their flavor is going to be better. There's going to be a bit more fat. Um, and their omega ratios also very, very differently. And I've seen omega ratios, you know, on our farm everywhere from 1 to 3 to 1 to 1 you ideal is 1 to 1 game is typically 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 Omega three to sixes. But in operations where you don't have year round grass, more complicated. You know, you're feeding hay and you don't get that 3 to 6 ratio. Omega threes come from green grass. Um they, they're the fat in greens and so they're scarce and costly, right? So you can have grass fed and fed animals that don't have that perfect ratio because maybe they're in a climate or for whatever reasons we've had to do it too during the droughts to hay finishing. It's not optimal changes the ratio. But so there's a little bit of variance within it, I'd say though, the variance within grass fed is still small compared to the variance between conventional and grass fed, right. So there's definitely things to look for within it. But the the real difference is between those two. Also thing to notice is that it's not a verified word. Ok. So grass fed means animals that have been on grass at some point in their life. way the cattle industry is in the US, there's. So there's cow calf operations. There's they then those calves get sold to stalker operations which raise animals in their teens basically. And then those get sold to feedlots. so those three phases that, that first phase of the cow calf is always on grass. It's mother cows and mom cows are amazing. They can thrive on anything and still put all their nutrients into their baby and their babies will be healthy. So you never are putting mother cows on really premium pasture. So it's usually just kind of like ok, pasture dirty if you ever see kind of like, you know, scrubby lots with lots of, you know, cows and cows on, that's a cow calf operation. there's also a worm, a loophole, unfortunately, where people use the term grass fed and they're actually referring to animals that at some point in their life had grass, but that might be pretty far in the rearview mirror. So"
