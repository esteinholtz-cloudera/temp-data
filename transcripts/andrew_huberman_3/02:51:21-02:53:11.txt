  "Text": ", yeah, it, it actually has some carryover effects on, on endurance if you're doing the other stuff. And then he also said one day a week to do this workout and I haven't done it yet. Maybe we do it tomorrow. It would be fun. Which is you run a mile. ask yourself, how long did that take? Let's say it took eight minutes. Then you walk or rest for eight minutes. Then you run another mile as fast as you can and then you rest for the equivalent period and you do that 1 to 3 times once per week. So and so as an all around fitness program, it make you could collapse this into something where you say, ok, you're gonna work out with the weights for about an hour every other day, maybe take two days off every once in a while, maybe not. You're going to do 6 to 15 repetitions. gonna push to failure on some of those. Not all because some of those are designed to build more strength. You're not going to failure and heavier. Some are designed for hypertrophy, higher rep and going to failure and then on off days you're gonna jog for 30 or 45 minutes, but for two days a week, you're either at the end of your jog or whatever, you're gonna do some all out sprint for 90 seconds and then rest and repeat. And for another day you're going to do these mild repeats. a pretty, that's a pretty large chunk of exercise movement. But if you kind of thread through the middle of all that, what you end up with is some decent strength building protocols, some decent hypertrophy, some cardiovascular training establishes the so-called a base or a so-called base. So you're not gonna get really good at anything. You're not going to become a marathoner this way, an optimizing marathon, you're not gonna optimize powerlifting, you're not gonna optimize hypertrophy. But for the typical person, 75% of people, 75% of the time they want some muscle, they want some strength, they want some endurance and they want the a sprint to the, to the security gate without um you know, leaving alone in the terminal. So it's"
