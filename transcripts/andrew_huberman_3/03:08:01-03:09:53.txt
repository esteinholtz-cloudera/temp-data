  "Text": "? It's counterintuitive and it kind of works like a seesaw. I mean, there's arousal, then there's relaxation, then there's arousal. But the the um and then immediately after orgasm and in males ejaculation, what ends up happening is there's a rebounding of the parasympathetic nervous system which it leads to oftentimes people feeling very relaxed or or falling asleep. uh I'm gonna do a s a short series on sexual health that will be that will include stuff about sexual performance. But also um I I, I'm working on getting a, an expert guest who can talk about some of the neurologic changes that happen um as a consequence of sexual activity. And we did an episode with uh a guy from UT Austin here, David Buss who's an evolutionary psychologist talking about. Um We went pretty deep into some of the uh typical and unusual dynamics of, of mating relation. Um whether or not people have kids or not and what impacts that. But we're going to do an episode on menopause andropause. very surprising is I get a lot of questions about sexual health from the young male audience. Um which tells me that, well, here's what I think it reflects. I think that women because of their menstrual cycles early on start to talk to one another about changes in physiology and psychology as a function of this 28 day cycle that they all experience sooner or later. There's less of a conversation and it usually arrives in code. People will say, hey, what should I take to increase my testosterone? And I'll say, well, maybe nothing, you know, uh what are you specifically concerned about? And then over time, if you pull on those threads a little bit, you, you know, you get your answer sometimes I'll just get a direct question. Um But I think that uh psychology of all this and in terms of jealousy and the terms of um notions of, of uh roles and relationships is very dynamic right now and I'm fascinated by this. So we're gonna do a four episode series. What about"
