  "Text": ", heat and cold pull you down from the inside. You have to, I mean, there's a reason why the screening process for,, make, you know, seal seal. They call it seal training. But it's really screening and training involves cold waters because, you know, if you're in the heat too long you'll die or damaged tissue in cold, you can do it quite extensively before you die or damaged tissue. But it is stressful. I was gonna say one thing that um I sometimes enjoy seeing these social media posts where people get into the ice bath, they'll look really stoic like they're really tough. Um But actually that's the wimpy way to go through it you get into cold water. If you stay very still, you develop a thermal sheath around you that you're warming yourself. The, the really bold way is to get in and continue to sift your arms and legs and it ends up feeling miserably colder there's no sheath because you're breaking up and they bring up that thermal layer. And then when you get out, you'll notice a lot of people huddle or they'll, they'll put, or they'll grab the towel in general. That's me. I'll get back, I'll get into the sauna. But if you really want to stimulate the big increases in metabolism, you stand out there and you dry off with arms extended in open air. And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold, but your body is forced to activate a number of the warming programs related to metabolism. is the beautiful work of a woman named Susanna Soberg who's um Scandinavian. She published this paper last year in cell reports, medicine. And so I call this the Soberg principle, which is if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason, it doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold. But if you're using cold specifically to stimulate an increase in metabolism, end with cold, that's the Soberg principle"
