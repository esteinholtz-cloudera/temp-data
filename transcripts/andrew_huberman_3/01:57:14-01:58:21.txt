  "Text": "you're staying in hotels, your circadian rhythms disrupted, you're not getting your like cold and sauna and your workout every day, your food isn't optimal. Um I think done in patches. I could enjoy it. Um because it's fun to meet people from different places. I'm doing a, a public lecture in Copenhagen the Lundbeck Foundation in June June 3rd. And that one is particularly gratifying for me because the Lundbeck Foundation is an academic foundation. So the fact that and then, so when they invited, I asked, you know, do you want me to talk about what my lab does or do you want me to talk about this stuff on the podcast? They're like, no no, not your lab. You know, we want to hear about this like health stuff and the stuff that we cover on the podcast. So that was amusing to me and tells me that, um, know, that things are changing. Now, I think 2020 2021 revealed a lot of things about people to ourselves. But one thing that it made very clear is that there's an enormous appetite for tools for mental and physical health, but also understanding about science and how science is done. thanks to you again, I'm not saying this to flatter you.
