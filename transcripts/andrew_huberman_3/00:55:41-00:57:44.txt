  "Text": "were postdocs together. Carl is truly the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky, five Children, marriage to it. Also an amazing scientist. His wife, Michelle Monje is in our neurology department at Stanford in incredible thinker, writer, very kind person, uh humble. Um uh speaking of getting into state, sorry, Carl, I'm gonna out you on this. But um Carl, despite being at the highest levels of science and engineering and a practicing psychiatrist, office is literally a coat closet with a small table lamp. When you meet with Carl, if you manage to meet with him because he's very hard to get to you walk in, you sit down as if you're going through some interrogation and some spy novel. And he'll ask you are you most excited about lately? And I've got 11 minutes or something and that's a meeting with Carl because he's that busy. But he doesn't have the office with the pictures of the kids and the the thing and all that, all that is kept elsewhere. So in order to get, I asked him, why do you work in this office? Right? You work on light and channels of light, things related to light, of all things here you are in this dark room.

And it's very unusual. Right. If I don't have a window, I kind of freak out. I can do it here for a while. We're in this black cube here floating in space, of course. Um But, but I, I find that amazing that these, that these people that are operating at this super high level are willing to actually deprive themselves of a lot of conditions. not sitting there with the, with the secretary coming in, offering them espresso every five minutes and things that, no, no, no, that's New York neuroscience. I'm picking the New York Neuroscience Mafia is kind of famous for having all the, you know, tickets to the opera and this and that and, and they, they enjoy lifestyle a lot. is one, there definitely is one, they know who they are, they know"
