  "Text": ". Well, Rick, I'm very blessed to, to consider a close friend. Um, Rick and I got introduced through a common friend during the pandemic and we started doing some facetime together and just talking about things related to science and health. And, I'm not a musician, I have no musical ability or talent. I have a good ability to memorize lyrics and I love lyrics and I love poetry. So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians that I happen to love that he's worked with and knows. And so he would give me stories about musicians and I would talk to him about health. And then eventually we formed a friendship where we would talk about any number of different topics in life. And then we started spending time together in person uh when he was in town or nearby. And you now know, uh you know, Rick, addition to all his incredible accomplishments, has an incredible understanding of how to get the brain and body into state, right? And as you pointed out, he's willing to do the things that allow him to help uh these incredible artists get into the best state to do their craft. And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet with his eyes closed for a minute or two and or more, he'll do that. Um, he has routines to allow himself to get into state. And it's really inspired me to think about states of mind is something that, you know, we'd all love to just, just flip the switch and say we're focused or we're creative. But, um to actually ratchet through the, the challenging steps in order to do that and to figure out what one needs to do on a regular basis get into a proper state. It's not just gonna come from a cup of coffee, uh, a, you know, a lamp of a particular wavelength or something, it's gonna be those things, but it's also going to be really teaching oneself how to get into proper state."
