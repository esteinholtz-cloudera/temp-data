  "Text": "that are in prison, major political leaders. I've been thinking a lot about how to talk to really difficult controversial figures, but find together something with them that's deeply honest about their nature about, the ideas they have about the world, like something real and some people, you have to be very careful. Some people are very good at hiding the real inside them even from themselves. That's something I think about a lot. I think about dictators of the past and I put myself in the mindset. Well, how do you reveal something real about this person to themselves? I think that to me and you kind of spoke to that, but great conversation is one where both of you discover something new. Like it's not just so I love that too. That's my favorite thing, what you mentioned, which is allowing your curiosity to ask all kinds of questions and get excited and to learn from an expert, but also to push them to discover something about themselves about their ideas. And then that discovery and sometimes it's like we don't see it in the moment but the audience hears it. It's weird to say, like I would compare it to when you're a musician, you're playing with other musicians, you lose yourself in the moment. Yeah, it's all, it's, it's working, right? It's working. But you don't really see the big picture impact of what it's working, right? Actually feels like. And that's where the audience could see that. Like if you talk to somebody evil, know, for me as an interviewer, I have to empathize with that person. If I want to understand, I have to put myself in that mindspace and to put yourself in that mindset, you really have to become that. You have to, you have to understand the evil inside of you. you can't just think if somebody's in power and has used that power to abuse others, you can't just be, well, I personally, a person who seeks to understand, you can't just be a journalist asking generic questions. You have to put yourself in a place where you're somebody who's given a lot of power. And slowly you start to abuse that power. what does that person become? Who are you? I have to plug myself into those moments in my life in the past where I've been angry at something, uh, and where I've been cruel because I was angry in little ways. But then you magnify them at scale. And I have to, I have to go there and that's very human. And then I have to look at another person from across the table from me and understand. Well, you're there too and then you had more opportunity to do truly cruel things., and then, um, then where I have to plug myself into places where I've been, I can imagine I can go where I was cruel to others and was unaware of it. I was in my space where I was thinking that I'm doing good and I was doing not good again, I have never gotten the opportunity to do any of those things at a large scale, but all of us have done it at a small scale and I plug myself into that and then we're here or two. If it's somebody who's in prison, if it's somebody who's a dictator, we're in that space where evil is, is all of us have the capacity to do that evil. And I have to imagine myself being able to do that evil then we're here together in that dark, dark place. And then if it's just right, something real can actually come something from that person's childhood. I may be awakening to a realization that I thought it was a good person. And I'm not. And for that only happens when you truly empathize those moments of discovery are beautiful, but they also happen in science. When you just have a conversation you, and you realize uh I feel like talking to Steven Wolfram, I feel like we constantly realize beautiful things"
