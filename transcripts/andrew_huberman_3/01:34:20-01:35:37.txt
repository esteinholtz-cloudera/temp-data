  "Text": ", um, you know, I try and respond to comments and I try and respond. But also, you know, there's this also this really interesting question. Now, if you block people or restrict people, people think that you're somehow afraid of the information that they're posting. But that's often not the case. I'm not in the habit of blocking or restricting too many people. Occasionally we've had to do it only because of how other people are being treated in the comments section. I can take and what I think other people deserve to take are two completely different things. David Goggins, right? Who we both know? Well, um, I don't know if he still does this but a few years ago he posted something like if people ask him, when do you sleep, he would just block them because it wasn't consistent with what he was trying to say. Of course he sleeps, but it's, you know, he's trying to get a particular message out. I think people should just understand that everybody's page is their own moderate, right? Just like in a classroom, there are certain rules of course of institution. But then you establish the etiquette within the context of the kind of class, you know, a class about personality, psychology or the um psychology of love. You're gonna have a very different range of, of conversations than uh you know, a class on um you know, membrane physiology. I think um social media is a great place for conversation, but it's not necessarily a great place for every kind of conversation."
