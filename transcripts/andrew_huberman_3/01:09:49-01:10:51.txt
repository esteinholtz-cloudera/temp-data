I'm nervous about the way people perceive what you're seeing is a Forrest Gump type character who I am. I seem to be and this is how the world seems to work is you just, you try to be yourself like you try to find yourself that maybe the better way to say it and just that kind to people work your ass off and f you to anybody that wants to control you or to tell you what to do, just be free and then put love out there in the world and doors open. This karma thing seems to work. Like how the hell, how the hell my friends with you now, the hell did I get a chance to eat? Barbecue with Rick Rubin? Right? Like, do you guys had a barbecue barbecue? He,"
