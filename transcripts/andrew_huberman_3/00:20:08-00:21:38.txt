  "Text": "by the way you mentioned pub med and barbecue. I should mention that I got a chance to hang out with Rick Rubin. Thanks to you. He's a friend of yours and you made the connection. That was a huge gift to my spirit. I guess he's a truly, truly special human being. And there's a lot I could say about why he's a special human being. I'd love to learn how you met him, but I should just mention on the pub med thing. was so interesting talking to him about music uh both on the podcast and uh privately and just listening to music together. Because when you mention a song, he does this thing where he like closes his eyes he finds that song in the album that we're talking about and he steps through the album, you could see the brain stepping through individual songs to find that song in the album and there's that kind of look up process and then he puts himself mentally in that space of like, OK, this is, you know, whatever the album is and not just the ones he produced, but all of it, he's an encyclopedia of, of music. And it's so interesting. It also the thing I really about him, something like a calmness that radiates from him that it's OK to close your eyes and place yourself in, in the, in the place where that album was recorded the feeling of that album and like that, that silence. Let's go there. Let's go there together. It's like Alice in Wonderland and we'll go there"
