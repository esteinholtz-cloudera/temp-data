  "Text": "non sleep deep rest NSDR is an acronym that I coined because it encompasses a lot of practices that are not meditation per se that bring the brain and body into a state of relaxation and focus. So, hypnosis is one variant of NSDR. There are other variants of NSDR. You can just look these up and you'll find them I think that they've caught on and that the Google um the CEO of Google uh is an avid practitioner of NSDR because it has this amazing ability to reset your energy levels and focus. Whereas with meditation, many people find meditation hard and part of the reason they find it hard is that it requires focus. NSDR is a state which is very calm and relaxing. You don't have to work too hard, you're just listening to a script. Whereas most forms of meditation, not all, but most forms of meditation cranking up the activity in your prefrontal cortex and trying to see your thoughts as opposed to thinking your thoughts or um focus on your breath. But then third person yourself in some respect and that's work. And so many people who meditate quite intensely, feel more exhausted. Now, that doesn't mean that meditation doesn't have any utility, but it's distinctly different than NSDR. And I think that people are working. Certainly the CEO of Google have to imagine is working very hard and using his forebrain. he's gonna have 20 or 30 minutes to take a break, he should. And I think this is what he's doing. He should go out for a jog and not listen to anything and just kind of let his mind wander or sit there in a chair and just zone out or do NSDR. The problem is people are not that good at shifting states. We are all actually pretty good at be even people with, with severe A DH D. We had an episode about this can become hyper focused on things that they actually enjoy dope and most of the drugs designed to treat A DH D are drugs that increase the levels of dopamine. So when you like something, there's dopamine release and you can focus, it's when you don't like something that's hard to focus. Shifting states is hard. I'm sure you've experienced this if you've ever been in deep research or podcasting, podcasting. And then all of a sudden you go for a run, you probably spend the 1st 3rd of that run thinking then in the middle third, you're kind of that thinking is, is fractured a bit. And then in the final third is where you finally get to relax because the brain doesn't shift states very quickly. We can go from sleep to wakefulness quickly. We can go from wakefulness to sleep quickly, but we don't shift between different states of consciousness like a step function in rare cases, right? Fear is one all of a sudden we hear an explosion right now. It's a step function. We're in fear or we're in alertness, right? Um A heightened state of alertness, but NSDR is terrific at allowing people to learn to shift their state. And I actually would venture to argue that of the value of meditation and exercise is the actual state that you get into in deep meditation or exercise. But just as valuable is the transition that you have to take yourself through, from one state of mind to the other. And then back again, I, when I look, you know, David Goggins, he always seems to come up. But he, because he represents so many important things, drive determination, override of emotional state from being a \u00a3300 plus person to a fit person through. He's never revealed anything substantial about what he ate or what he didn't eat. He basically says like, listen, run a lot, eat less, right? Um what's remarkable is so much of what he says is about those transitions about taking oneself from a state of, I don't want to, to scruff oneself and like you're gonna do it anyway and then being able to carry that into, into regular life, so to speak. So I think that um NSDR is immensely powerful, it's zero cost. And one of the reasons I'm such a fan of people doing it is that most people don't stick to a meditation practice. are also been a few cases you might find this interesting. There's a book by Scott Carney, I forget what it's called. I think it's called The Transcendence Trap or something. I, I'm gonna have that title wrong. But have been a fair number of cases of people that go and do very extensive meditation, silent meditation retreats who then return to normal life and end up killing themselves. are states of mind inside of extended meditations or silent meditations that are very beneficial. And I'm certainly not suggesting people don't meditate. But I know at least one person who came back from one of these long extended meditation retreats and wasn't able to shift their state back into one that was functional in regular life. And that book includes a very dramatic story. I don't want to give it away in case people um check out the book. But Scott told the story to me directly once where someone feels they've reached enlightenment and then commits suicide. So these very unusual brain states are are potentially hazardous if people can't return from them."
