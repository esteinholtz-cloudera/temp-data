  "Text": "pasta. So it wasn't low carb, but it was low glycemic carb. And I did that and it worked terrifically well, just for energy levels because I want to be able to train and work and then one day a week you're supposed to go full cheat day. so I would do what used to be 12 hours, but then it became 24 you know, you start to redefine what the day is. Um And I would, and that was when Costello was pretty young and we would do it together. So I would get pizzas and croissants and doughnuts and I would just do the full thing. And by the end of the day you don't want to look at an item of food. You're just repulsed by food. The only modification I made was the next day I would fast completely just to avoid the gastric distress of eating anything., um, so I would do them on Sundays and then Mondays I'd fast all day and then by Tuesday I felt pretty good again. But Sunday and Monday or you just feel like you're sliding down the slope of just blood sugar, disaster. Terrible idea. Or a good idea. You know, at the time I enjoyed it. I love doughnuts, croissants, all that kind of stuff. What's interesting is after stopping that whole protocol. Now I just try to eat, well, it's really a protocol. basically, I do a pseudo intermittent fasting. I don't, I'm not really strict but I'll start it eating around 11, eat my first meal, around 11. I usually train in the morning. I eat my last bite of food somewhere around eight or nine. And I'm not super strict. I might have some berries or something late at night. Three"
