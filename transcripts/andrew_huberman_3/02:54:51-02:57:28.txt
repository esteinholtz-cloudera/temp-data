  "Text": "there are three ways you can do sauna that I can just toss out as like brief things. If you want to get a really big growth hormone release for the sake of metabolism, fat loss, you're training really, really hard in jiu jitsu and you want to recover. You don't want a sauna too often the study that um identified this massive 16 fold increase in growth hormone. They had people do this. It's crazy. They got into OK. Temperatures are 80 to 100 \u00b0C. So that's 100 and 76 \u00b0F to 212 \u00b0F for 5 to 30 minutes is the typical ranges that people work in in these research studies maximum growth. Hor hormone release don't do sauna more than once a week, but get into the sauna for 30 minutes hot as you can safely tolerate. So probably for you, that'll be 210 because you're I suspect you'll be on the high end of things get out for 5 to 10 minutes. No cold exposure, get back in the sauna for 30 minutes. Then they had them do it again out for five minutes back for 30 minutes out for five minutes back for three minutes, they had them do two hours of sauna exposure to get that growth hormone release. Now, for the in likelihood of dying of a cardiovascular event, stroke or otherwise, the more often you do sauna the better. So if you look at all cause all cause mortality or death due to cardiovascular events and you look at sauna use frequencies using the same parameters, 80 to 100 \u00b0C 1 to 7 times per week. Basically, the more often you get into the sauna for 30 minutes the week. So 30 minutes a day is better than four times a week, four times a week is better than two times a week and two times a week is better than one. And the reductions in mortality are really impressive. 27 if you get into the sauna, the way I just described not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes twice a week or three times per week, you reduce the likelihood of dying of a cardiovascular event by 27%. you do it four or more times per week, you reduce the probability of dying by 50% of a cardiovascular event. And in these studies, they rule out other things that people are doing smoking, they even ask them, do you live in an apartment? Are you in a happy relationship? Like they evaluate other con potentially confounding variables? Now, for people that don't have access to a sauna, hot water bath or hot tub is gonna be your next best bet. if you don't have access to that do like the wrestlers do, which is, you know, put on two sets of, uh, sweats and a hoodie and a, and a stocking cap and wrap yourself in plastics underneath all that and go for a run. But don't, please nobody die of hyperthermia. I mean, you can die of warming up too much. Is"
