  "Text": "try and a couple of things. Um First of all, I, when I was a kid, I had a little bit of a grunting tick. when I was five or six, I would feel this build up of tension in my throat and I would do this grunting ticket if I get very tired, I start to do it still. We actually know that this is related to these basal ganglia circuits. For go. No, go, you've got an accelerator in a break basically in your neural circuitry and um kids with tourettes and O CD. Um The break doesn't work quite as well. And so one thing that happens is if I wake up in the morning and I'm, especially if I'm well rested,, if I'm not well rested, I do a hypnosis or yoga, Nidra in order to recover my sleep that works really well. But then once I'm into the process of preparing the podcast, already gone through my notes. I know what I want to say more or less in a kind of general contour. And then I take a walk and I, I try to as so no phone with me and I try to assess or not my energy is too high or too low for podcasting because when you podcast as you know, you have to punch out a lot of material. But then there's times when you really need to slow down and emphasize and articulate. And so uh what I do uh this is, I don't, I've never revealed this. Uh What I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs for about 10 minutes. Um Songs I love while I walk out loud,"
