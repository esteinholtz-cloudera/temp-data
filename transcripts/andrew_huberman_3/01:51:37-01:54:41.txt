  "Text": ", it used to be Rob, my producer who, um, I should say, you know, he's really the person behind the podcast. I mean, we're, first of all, we're equal partners. You're just a pretty face. We're just, um, and I'm aging and not, not, I, I actually really, I like, I aging. It's weird. A lot of people like friends with David Sinclair and it's all about not aging. I, I'm, I don't want to live past 9095. I'm just trying to get as much done as I can in this short life and do it right. And with integrity and heart and accuracy, you know, um, and you like the stages. Oh, yeah, if you read Erickson stages of development, you realize that every of life is a, is a, is a set of neural circuits trying to resolve a problem. And, um, and if you're gonna try and avoid that, that progression, sure, you might live longer. But, um, you know, it's, it's sort of like saying, like, do you wanna go win the, uh, high school jiu jitsu championship? No, you graduated high school a long time ago,. So I actually look forward to the future. Um, even if it means that I'm starting to shift, I think that, uh, my biology will shift, you know, I'll fight that. I try and take good care of myself. But, um, I don't wanna get sick, I don't wanna suffer who does. But I, I'm embracing this whole uh developmental arc. I mean, we don't, we're not Children and then adults our entire life is one long developmental arc. if you fail to embrace that, you fail to extract the richness of, of what it is to be a human being. So um I in any event for the um I record uh Rob is in the room, I'll sometimes stop and ask him for feedback if I feel like something is not landing. Right. So he gives, if it's clear, he'll let me know if it's not clear, he'll let me know, excuse me. And then, you know, Costello used to be in the room the early days of the podcast, which weren't that long ago. Um, he's snoring at my feet and and smelling up the room and we're all just kind of like gossiping Ferrari. He's a bulldog. That's what they do. Uh, with him gone. It, it changed, you know, the, the whole thing changed. There will be another dog soon. Um, as you know, I, uh, I've been moving through that grief process but having him there gave me a levity that, um, I miss, but in my mind he's still there. Yeah, he's still there. So, uh, and, you know, in time there'll be another dog and, and who knows, you know, maybe there'll be a dog and a couple of infants running around. But that, that would be more distracting So, um but it's, there's no podcast that exists because of the podcaster. This is true for Joe, this is true for your podcast for me that there's, it's not just a staff of people that post stuff, that's just the top level contour. There's the constant feedback and iteration of what you want it to become and to hold on to something that's essential a along the way because everything has to evolve. But you can't lose the, the essence of something anytime a company or brand or a, course or a scientist has done that, it just ends up terrible. It just is a, you know, it becomes like a seno version of itself."
