  "Text": ", and you mentioned being, you know, kind of uh cramming for for something. Well, you'll release a lot of adrenaline and you'll, it is true. You can get a lot done under pressure because of the way that you're slicing time. You don't actually have more time. It's that you're finally in a brain state that lends itself well to parsing information really quickly. Now, if we ramp up your level of stress enough, it's definitely, uh, you know, it's a or less normal distribution, we get you stressed enough. It's hard to remember anything. You're not parsing time. Well, but in that middle range, almost every study shows that the higher levels of autonomic arousal, meaning norepinephrine ad adrenaline in your system, the more effective you are at things. And we, you know, we always hear stress in an adrenaline. It's just bad, bad, bad. But my colleague, Ali Crom at Stanford has done these beautiful studies where if you just educate people on how adrenaline makes them sharper thinkers, become sharper thinkers. If you educate them on the fact that stress makes your cognition worse, their cognition gets worse. This is why I don't wear a sleep tracker. If you tell people they slept poorly, your recovery score sucks. They naturally perform less well the next day than if you tell them your rec your recovery score is high. so I don't have anything against those companies. But I, in fact, I I we use some of their technology can be very useful in certain contexts, but you want to determine your, your mindset around these things. And if you tell yourself, hey, deadlines make me sharp. Pressure makes me sharp. You will perform better. So stress"
