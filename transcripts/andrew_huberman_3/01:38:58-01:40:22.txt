  "Text": ". The the story of this knife is kind of interesting perhaps to people where it was, I was coming out here to Austin to meet with Lex and it was his birthday. I wanna get him a gift, but I didn't know what to get him. contacted this guy Mike Jones that I learned about through Joe Rogan because the first remember in the old, um, days of Joe Rogan, when you go on the episode afterwards, you take a picture with an object. So it was like, uh, Elon with a flamethrower, people would have the ax. I picked up this, um, bushwhacker hatchet thing and I was like, I love this thing and, and Joe said, oh, yeah, you should check out Mike Jones's work. He does these beautiful knives. And so then I your episode with Joe and you recited a poem at the end. It was right after your grandmother died. And there's a line in that poem from, from if that, um, Mike engraved on that knife for you. So he makes these by, by hand. I, I love the old days before the podcast and that's the first appearance that was the first time on there. And, um, it was a lot of fun, um, in the old, in the old studio in Los Angeles. And um,, Mike makes these beautiful knives and I have this, I just have a great admiration for crafts people. So, do you use it? Do you cut your, your one meal a day steaks? I feel. Are you taking it with you on your travels? Exactly."
