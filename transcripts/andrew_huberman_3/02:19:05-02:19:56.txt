  "Text": "the same time, you don't watch your anxiety., one of the most important things to remember at the outset of any self hypnosis experience is to know and understand. So people really should know that stage hypnosis is about the hypnotist getting you to do things you wouldn't normally do hypnosis, which is what we're talking about here, Reverie. And this is about you getting your brain into the state that you want., um, again, I mean, there's a ton of neuroimaging data and work on trauma and pain relief. And our labs are working on this with David Spiegel's lab. I, I really encourage people to explore NSDR and if this feels a little too wacky and out there, then I would just put in NSDR into youtube and there's some good NSDR scripts."
