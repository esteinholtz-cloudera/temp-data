  "Text": "know, um it was on television at the time. Uh I followed that Amanda Knox story pretty carefully. Um, and I don't watch television but whenever I would travel, if there was a TV, on the airplane, I would find myself, um, getting wrapped into things like locked up abroad, you know, like, and these things, where would you make you terrified to travel anywhere, let alone commit a crime overseas? Um, you know, the, the scenes of some of these prisons are so dramatic and, you know, I mean, her case got a ton of interest and then, you know, she went and then was a student at the University of Washington. Um, and has talked quite openly about, you know, how she was treated and how people assume guilt. And, you know, and eventually, you know, she was exonerated and, you know, we can only go by what we know what the law determined. But, you know, these are people that world is fascinated by. I would, I'm guessing about a third of people have already decided this person is despicable. Why would you ever give them an audience about a third of people I think are open to or at least interested in learning more about them. And then I think the, the remaining third kind of the third that category that I put myself in, which is what can I learn about people and myself in my revulsion, right? What can I learn? Yeah. What can I learn about myself from listening to this conversation with somebody that I, that I like to think. I'm not talking about Amanda here. I'm talking about the other people you're talking about that. I, I don't, I can't relate to, right? Talk, hearing conversations with and about people that you cannot relate to is informative. Otherwise your whole mind literally becomes insular, right? Well,"
