  "Text": "did. I went up to University of British Columbia, um uh and did a lecture on a, on a college campus and one of the more gratifying things that happened is this guy, this kid in his early twenties I think stood up and said, know, I've never been on a college campus. I didn't think I could go on to a college campus and that I still rings in my mind whoever you are out there that meant so much to me because I was like, yes, there was something about that to me. I was like, ok, this, it made sense to come all the way up here and do this in person because you can get out to a lot more people on the speaking events.

It's really about being able to connect with people in a different venue and for interactions like that. Uh, I don't know how many of them we will do.
