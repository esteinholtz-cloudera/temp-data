  "Text": "know, one of the reasons I enjoy our friendship so much is that you bring this Russian thing, you know, which I don't really understand it at a deep level. How could I, I'm not Russian but um but this mindset like that there's pain in life when I watched that uh Hedgehog in the fog cartoon, I thought no wonder Russians go the way they do. This is the most depressing. It's so sad. It is beautiful and sad, but it's so sad. Whereas out here it's like Sesame Street and, know, my mother would not let me watch Sesame Street when I was a kid. She thought it was too chaotic, chaotic. She was like, it's too chaotic. So many things going on. Captain Kangaroo, we were allowed and then uh Mr Rogers, we were allowed. I never really liked shows. I like doing things in, outside, in the, in the yard. Um I was trying to trap all the animals. I didn't want to watch stuff on TV. But, you know, Hedgehog in the fog is enough to turn any kid into a thinker and a philosopher and a poet. Here we go. fell in love with this. When, when you showed, look, it even walks with its arms behind its back."
