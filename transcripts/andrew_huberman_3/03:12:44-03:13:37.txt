  "Text": "no one knows what other people are doing or what's normal. We kind of know deviancy, we know perversion, we know the extremes, we know the rules. Hopefully people know the rules. But, you know, just be, there are a lot of people in, in the academic community, in particular at certain east coast schools not to be named that are in open relationships. This is more common now.
