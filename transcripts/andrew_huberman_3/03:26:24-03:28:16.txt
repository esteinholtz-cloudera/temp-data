  "Text": ", actually this comes from a friend of mine who is in a really excellent marriage um with great kids and family and high demand life. it's a decision like at some point you just priori you just prioritize it as OK, going to make this happen one way or another and um you don't force the discovery of that person but, I mean, I've occasionally said, hey, I think you should meet this person or that person. And, um, well, it wasn't, maybe my judgment was, might have been off but it, the timing wasn't right or something. But I think that, yeah, you, it's a decision and it also has to do with life structure. mean, there were years so I, when I was in graduate school I, I didn't want a girlfriend, I just wanted to be in lab and I sure I had romantic dating interests, but I wasn't gonna meet them through a committed, you know, live together situation. It wasn't where I was at. And as a post doctorate, things are a little different, et cetera, et cetera. So, but at some point, it's sort of like, what do I want my daily routine to look like because ultimately a relationship, however, one structures is gonna be part of your daily routine. So at the point where you're like, you know, I'd really love to wake up next to somebody do blank and blank together and then I'd love to work and then we meet for dinner and then we, you know, take the dog for a walk or take kids out or whatever it happens to be, take a trip. But do it, you have to be, one has to be in the mindset of wanting to do couple like things people and a lot of people don't think about it that way they, they either fall into something or they, don't see the benefits of coupling up. I think that the pandemic um tuned people's awareness to the fact that some things are indeed easier on your own, on finances, et cetera, et cetera. But lot of things are made better done with other people"
