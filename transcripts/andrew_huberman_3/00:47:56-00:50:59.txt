  "Text": "on this element of um you know, evil and sociopathy that, you know, young had this notion that we have all things inside us and that we all have the capacity to be good or evil, et cetera. Um I have the good fortune of working with somebody who has deep understanding of psychiatry, but also psychoanalysis and young in theory. And um and he said to me recently, he said, you know, whether or not all people have all things inside them is still debated in the psychology community and in the neuroscience community as a matter of philosophy, but there are certain people, not many, but there are certain people for whom they've actually lived out many versions of their possible selves the first person. And so those are unique individuals, then even if they tapped into these things at a, as you mentioned, as a at a more minor level, as opposed to impacting people negatively at a at a at scale. being able to access those different parts of oneself is is key and you've been willing to step into that. You know, my podcast is not one in which we, we get down to those matters. Um But yeah, you never know, we might do an episode on, on narcissism and sociopathy. The other thing that I took away from a conversation with a friend who was a did a lot of years in special operations in the intelligence community. He said, you know, it's, if you look at somebody's past, some point, you will come to understand some pretty good reasons as to why they became who they are. But you have to draw the his words, the red line someplace and what he was referring to was the fact that certain people, at least in the eyes of certain communities deserve to be eliminated as a consequence of their actions, right? Regardless of what drove them to those actions so that it gets right down to the line between nature nurture, uh neuroscience and the law and justice. Um complicated, complicated themes. I, I can think of a number of people that um I would love to hear you interview and here I'm not revealing the reasons why, but except for the fact that I think you would be uniquely suited to bring out the important components of the conversation that other people have not been able to uh do. Which uh for instance, Liz Holmes, this is one of the most um mysterious and yet dislike people on the planet. Um, uh, she's sort of synonymous with deception. Um, I don't know if there have been any real interviews of her since the whole thing., I haven't followed that case. I listened to the book and I, um, I followed it a little bit because it was happening in my hometown. Right. Theranos was right up the road. The building is still there. It's interesting. It's, it's some of the most premier real estate in Silicon Valley, but nobody wants it. It's sort of like it's very hard to sell a home where somebody committed suicide or committed a murder, even if it's a beautiful home. They sort of feel like the Theranos building is that building. Um that would be a really interesting interview. I would love to hear that"
