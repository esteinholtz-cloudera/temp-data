  "Text": "it. You took tremendous risk as an academic to do what you did. So I do believe that when one takes intelligent risk because you can die or can crash your career, you can do all sorts of um self destructive or destructive things. When taking risks, you took risks and, and they paid off, right? And you take different risks at different stages. But I, don't throw around the word admiration lightly. I mean, I admire that you were in this classroom and in my team like I'm gonna film this and put it online. Uh You, one of your early interviews is with IO portal who's very hard to get to. I've communicated with IO a few times, talk to him. I can't wait to talk to him. I'm dying to talk to him. I was supposed to do some, um, course teaching with him. Uh, right before the pandemic hit and then it got canceled because he couldn't travel. But getting to him is exceedingly challenging. So you do have this incredible ability to get to people,, and for them to trust you and know you. And I think it's through your authenticity and I think it's the fact that you're willing to go places where people haven't been before. You know, that this is what, what's the saying about pioneers? How do you spot the pioneers? They're the people with the arrows in their backs, you know? So that, that's the, you know. Yeah. And, and that's actually a quote that I lifted from Terry signals. Who's a, uh, you know, horses again. Um Terry's a, you should talk to Terry. He's a, um, computational neuroscientist down at the Salk Institute, uh Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera. But so, you know, taking risks that other people have not taken is that's a real thing and to do it with uh integrity and rigor, that's a real thing. And so, yeah, I'm complimenting you and, and I hope it, I hope it lands and lands deeply, but I also hope that people will hear that and understand that one thing to, to do what other people are already doing. Boldly. It's a whole other thing to launch an entire art form or venue. And you did that uh you didn't write a book, hopefully you will someday, but you didn't go write a book. A lot of academics have written books. You went online, Jordan Peterson, another controversial character. He did it too, all those lectures that he filmed and then he's led to this other thing. So, um you know, it, Karma and then there's also having the spine to just put it all on the line and do something for which there is no prior example to hold on to you go through those headwinds."
