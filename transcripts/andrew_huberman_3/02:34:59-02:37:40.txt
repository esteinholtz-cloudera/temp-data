  "Text": "? Absolutely. Strengthening. Look whether or not you get into a cold ice bath or a, or a hot sauna? So hot you wanna get out or you get hit square in the face with something over text that you really didn't want to hear or see adrenaline, it's just adrenaline. And so your subjective readout of that and what it means is really important and you can just channel that well, you can if you, if you agree with the following statement, which I do and many people do because the data support it, which is Ali Crum's statement, not mine, which is she directs the mind body lab at Stanford. She's brilliant, by the way. Um Brilliant Harvard trained Yale trained, trained, licensed clinical psychologist, also tenured professors. You know, she's a uh Olympian. Uh no, excuse me, a division one athlete in gymnastics and uh martial arts. And her dad um is a longtime martial arts trainer. He's done work with special forces and he's an amazing human being and very humble, very kind, lovely woman. And professor scientist. She says anything that you do and experience, but especially stress the consequence of that thing and what you believe about that thing. And so if you consume a lot of information about the powers of stressful states to bring out your best, you will perform better. If you consume a lot of information about the power of stress to cripple you, you will perform worse. absolutely no question. The data are striking and this is not growth mindset. This is just simply what sorts of in what do you believe about stress based on the knowledge that you're consuming about it. So that's why it's fun to watch David Goggins. Here we go again, David or Jocko or, or Joe or someone put or Cam Haines, you know, put out this information about or Ryan Hall who ran for Stanford and then now is like into the powerlifting thing and running, you know, and there are others too. Of course, when you start to consume a lot of that information, it's not just inspiring, it actually changes your perception of what your own stressful states mean. They, can actually get better from stress if you're in the ocean of knowledge that stress grows. You if you're in the ocean of living in the ocean of knowledge, I was seeing like a pool in the summer. You got the kiddie pool, the kids all peeing in it. Presumably you got the diving thing. You got the high dive and all that. If you believe that the experience of belly flopping off the high dive is gonna make you a better diver some sense. It, at least in this analogy it will. Whereas if you feel that it's just the most embarrassing thing ever and it's gonna cripple your ability to get out in the dive in front of anybody ever again. Well, you're, you're right about that too."
