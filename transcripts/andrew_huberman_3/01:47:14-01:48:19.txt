  "Text": "good as a poem. They can play, the people can play the song. Yeah. So I'll, I'll, mean, because it has to be something Joe's voice is what makes the song, um, Joe's voice is what makes the song. But, yeah, that song, Burning lights from, I, uh, I hired a contract killer or the lyrics are pretty good. They're pretty good. I mean, Joe is an amazing writer. Right. I'm, you know, I'm also a big Bob Dylan fan. Um, Glenn Gould for classical piano. He was Asperger's, you know, and, um, and actually I think you can hear him grunting. He had a tourette's like tick. Um, and I learned about Glenn Gould through, um, Oliver Sacks., so I'll listen to any number of things. It depends on my mood. If I'm feeling a little more tired and I need to be amped up, I'll listen to something that's a little louder and faster if I'm feeling kind of keyed up and I need to bring the cadence down a little bit. Um, then I'll listen to something a little mellower. Poier. II, I love bands like, um,, I, I'm a big fan of this, um, British pop band called James. There's like 20 bands named James. But this one, you know, and again, I lose punk points for saying that, but they're amazing., and best"
