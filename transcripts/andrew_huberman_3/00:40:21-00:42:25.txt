  "Text": ", in academia, you know, this changed in the last few years, of course. Um But one of the great joys was professors will stop by your office or your lab. Nobody set, set up an appointment. There was a guy when I was a professor in San Diego, a guy named Harvey Carney, he's a member of the National Academy, the, the truly the world's expert in the evolution of vision and evolution of brains generally. And uh he would show up in my lab and he would just start talking to the students in postdocs um I mean, in a pure encyclopedia, uh and then you'd, at some point you'd say, hey, Harvey, I gotta go and you, you kick him out, right? Or this guy, he's a physicist. David Klein. David Kleinfeld who's uh same way. Actually, David Kleinfeld is interesting one, he, a student of his went to on to create the Beavis and Butthead cartoon. And one of them is David, he's a physics professor. Now people can look him up David is one of those guys who just walk into your office and you just sit down and you just start talking to you. He is and, and so there's a kind of a family feel. It's like Cheers or Seinfeld or one of those shows where somebody just walks in. And uh yeah, I think you and I both share a love of the community around things and podcasting is a little bit more isolated. Um I should say for the guest episodes, preparation is completely different because it's more conversational. And so there, I don't do any of this business of putting myself into state. I just try to make sure that the guest is um taken care of and I do list out the questions I'm gonna ask before. But those I actually really like the interview episodes far more than I like this doing the solo ones psychologically. I mean, I just like learning from someone directly because you asking an expert about something like sitting here with you when we recorded the podcast where you were a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast. And for the first time, and finally, someone was explaining to me the difference between machine learning artificial intelligence and all these other things, know, and I'm, I've finally forgiven you for making me cry about Costello on camera, but because it helped me move through it. But, but in all seriousness that the interview ones are, are a sheer pleasure. The solo ones I really enjoy, but they're their, their work sometimes I think like I'm gonna sweat a little blood prepping for that."
