  "Text": "right. No, there is a open mic is late at night and I was one of the only people in the audience. There's a of drunk folks, a few drunk folks, one of them was a couple and like bikers with helmets and so on a guy and a girl. And then the comedian, open mic comedian a joke about people who wear helmets. I don't know if it was on purpose or not. But he did the joke. And then the guy about women who wear helmets and the guy is this exact same situation, the guy stood up, walked up to him. There was no slap. It's so interesting because this happened before the Will Smith thing. So he walked up to the, to the comedian, and, and said he like, uh,, he, I think he pointed his finger down and told him to stop or something like that. And then sat down, this is an audience of six people and at midnight around then there's nobody, no security, nothing in Texas in Texas, which implies. And then this guy was the energy drunk, but also a biker and what he felt his lady was now attacked by the comedian right with his words.

And I was sitting, and I started, I leaned back and I just did this like, hm, that is comedy and the guy was getting angrier and angrier and he just sat there and the comedian went on for a couple more minutes and then did another bad joke. But another joke about him, it's just like he leaned into"
