  "Text": "should be doing this with headphones because binaural beats are best accomplished by feeding two different frequencies to the two ears. And then you have what's called the this brain stem area that reads out what are called inter oral time differences. And then it extracts the, the the delta, essentially turn it up then in other things that can enhance focus. So, you know, the pharmacology around this is pretty interesting things that tickle the dopamine pathway and the acetylcholine pathway they work. Um There's your Ritalin, your Adderalls, your modafinil, which are prescription and there's a lot of uh non-prescription use of those prescription drugs, not so much in my generation, but in people 35 and younger, you know, I hear all the time from day traders and programmers and stuff and kids that play video games, a lot of Ritalin Adderall use. think that unless it's prescribed by a doctor for a specific purpose of a DH D, I don't think people should go that route frankly hits the dopamine system way too hard. Also has a number of negative effects on um sexual side effects. All sorts of things that you just wouldn't want. There are a few compounds like alpha G PC, 300 mg to 600 mg of alpha G PC with a cup of espresso. If you're well rested, you're like a laser for 90 minutes. Maybe two hours, but then it's gonna taper off and you have to just recognize that and then there's this whole world of new tropics now and people trying to figure out the rats, Paracet and phenylethylamine combined with this. And, you know, it's not quite in the place where you'd like it to be. There are a few companies that are doing this better than others. We talked about some of these on the podcast, but um would always start with behavioral tools and then consider pharmacology. And, and then I suppose the the other thing for focus is um there are these, this is a little more esoteric, but uh we cover this in an episode on workplace optimization um where you place your screen is important, staring down at a screen is not, going to be as effective as placing it at eye level or above you when the eyes are up literally, or your eyes are directed forward or up the brain stem centers for alertness are activated when your eyes are down. It's actually you're, you're sort of, it's like being pulled under water a little bit in the autonomic arousal sense. It's you're closing your eyes. I mean, um is one, it reflects the brain stem centers that are active, becoming less or, or for a for alertness, excuse me, becoming less active. there's a really cool effect that's active in this room right now, which is that there have been some really interesting studies that when people work in small compact spaces or wear a hoodie or a hat that can also improve focus like blinders on a horse for obvious reasons. Now, based on what I said before, but also work or the kind of work where there's a correct answer that you're seeking is best supported by these kind of low ceiling environments. Whereas there's something called the the cathedral effect, which is when you work in an outdoor environment or a high ceiling environment, it lends itself to kind of pun intended kind of loftier ideas and more creativity. And that probably has to do with the fact that there's a natural tendency, a reflex to expand your visual field in these high ceiling environments, of the visual field changes the way the brain works in the time domain, your engineering and biology oriented uh listeners will understand this for the and music. For those that don't, the best way to think about it is when you have a narrow focus portrait mode on your phone or you're very alert, you are fine slicing life in time. It's like a um think of it as a high frame rate. Like you're shooting in slow motion. you have a uh when you dilate your, your view, you're taking bigger time bins. And that one way to just let this hopefully land home is that if you've ever had a really exciting day or podcast interview or experience of any kind. Your system is flooded with dopamine and norepinephrine, alertness and motivation. All this excitement, it seems like it goes by very, very fast. And yet when you think back to that, it seems like a lot happened, happened and that happened. Now, think about waiting in the doctor's office in a blank waiting room with no interesting art on the walls. It feels like it goes by very, very slow. Dopamine and norepinephrine are at all time low. And yet when you think back on that experience, it's as if nothing happened because you were, you were parsing time differently. those are the roughly the tools and the and the neurochemicals around time perception and the Time Domain. Uh There's a wonderful book, I'm forgetting the title. So wonderful. I forget the title by Dean um Budo Mano from UCL A. But I think it's called The Brain is a Time Machine that talks about this expansion contraction of the time domain. And what you can do is to leverage it for work and creativity, focus. And so yeah,"
