  "Text": "know, the dynamics, right? I mean, you're merging two nervous systems. This was once described to me very well by an ex girlfriend who's truly brilliant. She's really brilliant. Um said, you know, there's four arrows, this is maybe to an engineer or like a so it makes sense. There's how you feel towards the other person. Yes, there's how they feel towards you. But then there's an, there's an arrow that comes back to you, is how you feel about how they feel. And then they have an arrow of how they feel about how you feel, right? This is why if someone else is moody or somebody else is upset, it, there's one version of ourselves where we respond to that or they respond to us. But there's another version where we respond to that. But it's also, there's a processing of what it means for us that they're behaving that way or feeling that way. And this again leads us back to that early attachment circuitry because of a parent stressed. The child's role is not to soothe the parent. In fact, healthy models of parenting say that Children shouldn't actually know how their parents feel for like the first eight years of their life. They're not supposed to be in that mindset of empathizing for the parent. This is often not the case, but maybe the cut off isn't exactly eight, but you get the idea. the dynamics of a relationship are where the learning is because we learn how we react to other people reacting. It's, it's not a, just a two arrow system. It's at least this four arrow thing. Um, but there's also the, the element of nurturing, right? I mean, I think that, um, going through life with somebody is so much better than going through it alone and I, I'd never thought I'd make that statement. Um,"
