  "Text": "one of these days I'm gonna get back to jujitsu or I'm gonna get to jujitsu. Now, in terms of training, he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength three exercises, compound exercises, multi joint uh movements, do them for do 3 to 5 exercises for 3 to 5 repetitions per set,, 3 to 5 minutes and do that 3 to 5 times per week. And for details, you can again look to the episode, it's time stamped. But what's interesting about this is 3 to 5 times a week is a lot for a muscle group squatting thr five times a week for five reps, meaning you're working pretty heavy, meaning you're close to failure but not failure on for strength. Generally. What Andy taught me is that who are training mostly for strength can do these low rep type regimens frequently because most of the adaptation is neural and because you're not pushing to failure. In most cases, don't get that sore. And so it's the motor neurons getting the muscle fibers to contract more intensely or with more efficiency in other ways that's leading to these strength gains. And this is why powerlifters can train every day or five days a week or four days a week. For hypertrophy, I learned from Andy that the repetition range can be pretty broad. You're think anywhere from 6 to 30 repetitions, should do 10 sets per muscle group per week, maybe even a bit more, so high volume, high volume. But you have to go to failure or beyond in order to stimulate growth. Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions? Well, there apparently are three ways that you stimulate hypertrophy and maybe more. One is tissue micro damage to the tissue. The other is through some sort of tension based changes in the molecular gene programs of cells that lead to protein synthesis don't, that are distinct from damage. And the other are metabolic effects of like high repetition work of super fusion of the muscle with blood. We know that third category exists because people are now doing this blood restriction training where they cough off a muscle and they'll use a really lightweight. I've done these before. You can use a \u00a35 weight and do curls with this and you, you are in pain and the muscles are swelling up with blood. It does lead to hypertrophy. in general, you're not sore, you're not doing tissue damage. And by the way, don't just turn the kid off a muscle because you have to use the proper cuffs. Um because you need the blood still to flow in one direction. You can't just cinch it off or you'll, you'll potentially kill yourself if you, um, get a clot or you do it wrong. So, get the appropriate cuffs. They're out there and then for endurance, I learned something really cool. So, I, I work out basically, I go to the gym other day on average, I, three or four days a week. I do that but generally not two days in a row. It's work out next day. I'll do cardio next day and the cardio for me is always a 30 to 45 minute jog kind of zone two. Cardio. informed me that to build endurance while building strength and maintaining some muscle size or even building muscle size. would be wise to take one day a week and add to that out max heart rate work for 90 seconds at least. So do 90 seconds, then rest and then maybe do another 92nd all out sprint. I almost missed my flight going from Los Angeles to Austin. I did that all out sprint in the airport yesterday. So I actually think it's done for me. So there"
