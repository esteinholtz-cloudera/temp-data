  "Text": "some people, let me say a couple of things. So one is a high level, let me say that she believes or her current story is is that she's the victim who Jeffrey Epstein. Oh my, think I'll just leave that there as is. So this is these are ideas that you're facing nature of truth and the nature of the human mind is what it is. And this is folks, if you went into a room with the person that says that what do you do next? me also say that I never or rarely, let me not say never. I rarely mention names that I'm interested in talking to without having made significant progress in already securing that interview. So people sometimes ask me about uh Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin. not bring them up lightly in terms of there's in terms of there being a path to an actual conversation that said something I regret, but I'm not sure I what to do with it. But in the case of all the people I just mentioned, I haven't been preparing for those conversations. I only start really preparing when it's confirmed it's such a heavy burden. one of the things I regret in having mentioned a conversation with Vladimir Putin before the war in Ukraine broke out in the past few years is that I would mention it very loosely, very casually. without having really deeply myself into a place that I'm ready to talk to and that's a tricky thing because then the internet, um the audience in general and just me when I listen back to my dumb self think, well, why are you speaking so lightly about these topics?"
