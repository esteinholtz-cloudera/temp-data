  "Text": ". I mean, it just to me it just seems like you know that just be aware. But, but nonetheless, the Baas have very hot saunas because they're Russian owned. And in New York there's one on the lower East side, but the spy 88 place, they have some saunas that moment I get into those, I have a hard time catching a full breath. It burns. They've got a cold dunk. That's like a shock. And then they've got a sauna, a wet sauna steam room. That's a little mellower. So the nice thing about Abana is you can kind of find your place and then they do the plaza where they take the eucalyptus leaves and you can pay someone you basically, you cover your groin and then they beat you with the, the, the, the leaves and it's supposed to bring the vasculature to the surface. I've only done it once and frankly, I found it, um, to be a little bit, um, unnerving. I didn't really like the experience, but I, I'll try and get into a sauna as often as I possibly can, which is, you know, once or three times per week and I try and do the cold exposure shower or immersion, early in the day because it really wakes you up."
