  "Text": "think it gets my vocal chords up and it also, do you sing or speak them? I often sing them. Uh And uh fortunately nobody hears. And as I do this, I start to evaluate whether or not I'm straining to get the words out or whether or not I'm straining to make them slow enough so that I can articulate them. it's, there are days when I have so much energy that I'm trying to speak faster than I should in order to articulate properly. There are other days when I'm tired and I can't sort of keep up with my thoughts. so what I try and do is assess that and then adjust the transmission, the R PM so to speak. For instance, I can speak very quickly and then I can slow down so I, I can change the cadence of my voice. And when you teach in the classroom, you learn as you know, because you're an excellent teacher, I've watched your lectures in the classroom as you teach in the classroom. When you want to slow down, teacher knows, you turn to the whiteboard or chalkboard and you start writing, right? It gives you a break and then you turn around and you fire back the kind of machine gun fire of, of information and then you slow down or you underline something. When you podcast, don't have that opportunity right? There are no visuals in my podcast. So what I try and do is always my voice warmed up and make sure that I'm thinking and speaking at approximately the same rate. then I also do this thing of as I put my vision into panoramic vision when I walk, which is very calming. then I actually start to remind myself of the purpose of podcasting. This sounds very mission statement. E but you asked what I do, I, I remind myself first and foremost that what I want to communicate, what I want to come through is the beauty and utility of biology. I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty publicly now about science things thanks to you because uh I, I think love and beauty, love and beauty and love and beauty. Um but also darkness and hatred. And uh if you're talking about the Lex Freeman podcast, you have to adjust, you have to address the shadow also the shadow side. But I think about the, I want to communicate the, beauty and utility of biology and then I, I check my, my emotional state. I wanna make sure that I'm not angry about anything. certainly if I am that I'm gonna set it aside for the podcast because that's not a place for, for my, whatever I might be dealing with. I also really start to feel into the parts of the research and the papers I found that I really love because that's the part of me that I, I like the most frankly. Um and the podcast, if there's a paper, like for instance, we have a paper, uh excuse me, a podcast coming out soon about um heat as a tool, you know, sauna, but some other things and in researching this, I learned so much about these heat shock proteins and the use of sauna in Finland for increasing growth hormone, but also for the treatment of mental illness. And I, and I realized I, I fell in love with this literature. It's just a beautiful literature. These people are true pioneers for doing this work. Now everyone's in the sauna. But this was 20 years ago, the way the experiments were done were amazing with all these Finnish people, with thermocouple up their rectum to measure temperature, swimming in pools. It's, it's hilarious and great. And so I start to think about and I think, know, I just start to really access my love of the, the work. And then when we finally sit down, meaning my producer, Rob and I, and record, I just sort of wanna just bask in, in sharing it just like the little version of me when I was six or seven. I used to spend all weekend reading the encyclopedia Guinness Book of World Records making my mother drive me places to introduce me to. had this obsession with trapping animals when I was a kid, meet these people. And then on Monday, I would insist on giving a, a lecture in class, just a little kid. So that's basically what it is. I just try and access that, that childlike energy. And um so I wanna be clear, the goal is always to make the information interesting, clear actionable. And if it's also surprising then there, then that's a bonus. But that's basically the process. But yeah, I'm, I'm singing and talking and, and getting into state and I used to feel very uh sheepish about sharing any of this. It's the first time I've ever shared it out loud. But, but Rick was the one who encouraged me to find a process that works and continue to develop that process not let anything get near that process. People in my personal life know this and when it's time, it's like, I don't care what else is going on. I'm, I'm moving into that brain"
