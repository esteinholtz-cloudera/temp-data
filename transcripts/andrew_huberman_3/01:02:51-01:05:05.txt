  "Text": "so much. I mean, I would watch that episode with, with great interest. Um, well, you did an episode recently with this guy who was a, uh, former cyber criminal turned state side, right? I think he works for the government now. And there was a segment in there,, remind me his name Brett Johnson. Brett Johnson. There was a segment in there where he talked about stealing a lifetime's worth of collected coins from some elderly woman this was everything she had. And then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse, which is the way he described is purely sociopathic. And then of course, we learned that he grew up in a family where criminal behavior was very common. It was kind of embedded in his um notions of what typical behaviors were. And I found myself somewhat conflicted but also hung up, you know, hung up on this idea that, you know, I mean, he was, you know, he had behaved as a sociopath or in a sociopathic way and it created a, an internal conflict because he's quite charming guest and his stories are terrific. Um e especially I really enjoyed his discussions about how he would go out and um do all these things out of a desire to please his, his girlfriend, know, so he was in service to other people, despite being a sociopath, he could say he was in service to them as a way to extract. It gets very complicated. I think it's the reason I went into science is that it, at some level, it's more about facts than it is opinions and judgments. And I don't know that I have the ability to suspend judgment over the uh away from the kind of top level contours of my initial reaction to like it's true, like the Glen Maxwells and the Liz Holmes and the other sociopaths is one of just kind of revulsion and repulsion. But that could also reflect the fact that I'm not as, you know, neurologically sophisticated as somebody that can spin all the plates of, of for forgiveness. But also um holding people accountable at the same time, that's, that's work that takes, if you think about that's 34 brain circuits having to work in parallel, that's the difference between chess or a game of go and a game of checkers. I guess I'm playing checkers playing chess."
