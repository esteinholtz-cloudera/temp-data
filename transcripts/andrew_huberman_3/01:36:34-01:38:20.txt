  "Text": ", I, I love that about you and I know that what you just said to be true. One of the, I think more um toxic things in life is what's called, um, you know, evacuated projection when people feel something and they try to evacuate it and project it onto somebody else. Projection is fascinating, right? What you essentially just said is that you don't accept projections in fact, you transmute them to put in the language of the Buddhist, you know, you transmute it into positivity and in that way you, you, you truly neutralize it. Um and transmute it, I think that people were better understood when they were experiencing or observing evocative projection, um world would be a much healthier and happier place, but it requires a certain uh stable internal rudder. And um you know, when we're tired or sick or angry, you know, we we were hungry, excessively hungry. Um All of us are less, less good at it. I I've been positively struck by the nature of most of the um interactions, not just feedback, but my favorite thing an educator in the classroom, but also on social media. My absolute favorite thing is when the comments about other people's comments are positively reinforcing. So you see people having conversations within the comments and you realize this is like if you as an educator again, you know, you it's fun to teach and it's fun to talk to the students. But the real pleasure is in walking by a small group of students on campus and hearing them talking about the material., that just fills me with joy and, and because what it means is that the ideas are reverberating in their nervous systems and will eventually wick out to others. So it's not just about feedback, it's about a venue for, for parsing information."
