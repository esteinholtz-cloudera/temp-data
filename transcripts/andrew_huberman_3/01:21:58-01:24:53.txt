  "Text": "the personalities are, are a bit more um grandiose. However, because of some of the shift in science culture in the last few years, things around um scandals and things of that sort. Um They've been forced to tamp down some of their personality or at least their outspoken personality. And I actually think it's revealed something really important and useful in science, which is, know, it used to be the case. You could really inject your personality into what you do. You, you know, Richard Feynman is a good example. he did today, what he did, then bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech naked. Um working out theorems in um strip clubs and things like that. He would have lost his job in, in, in moments, right? So that kind of behavior isn't celebrated anymore, it's actually punished. Um And I'm only half kidding about this New York Neuroscience Mafia. But because I now exist in multiple realms, I can say these sorts of things and I again, admiration and respect, but will say that I think it's important that people in science or their and kids that are curious about science understand that you can have any personality provided that you're ethical and respectful in science and do well right there, bench scientists that just want to be at the bench. There are people that just want to be in their office. There are people that um really enjoy public speaking and there are people that love meetings and there are people that hate crowds. And so there's a place for every, everybody, truly a place for everybody in science. would like to be able to shine light on the fact that there are, you can have shy personality, an outgoing personality and you can all of those can be, have excellent careers in science, but you have to find the community in place. That's right for you. One reason I like Stanford is that Stanford is very much about the future. We have Nobel Prize winners, we have field medal winners and all that stuff and their names are on walls and we acknowledge their great works. But most of what you hear about in the halls of Stanford is about what's happening now and what could happen next. really about the future. Whereas when I've spent time at other institutions not to be named, hear that, but there's a lot of kind of recycling and regurgitation of how wonderful people are based on things they did previously and the students at Stanford because of Silicon Valley. Sure, they have respect for Nobel Prizes. They're delighted to be learning from and surrounded by all these great minds, but they're mostly interested in what they are going to create. And so I kind of uh not kind of, I really like the shift toward possibility as opposed to things that are steeped in tradition. know, I've never been to high table dinner at Oxford. I'm sure it's a wonderful experience. also not sure what purpose it serves for the world, but I've never been. And so, I don't know what the conversations are. And so maybe I'm, you know, speaking out of line here and then now I'm definitely not getting invited. You,"
