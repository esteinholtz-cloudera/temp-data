  "Text": ". And then there will even be people that say, you know, um was it even science, right? It might have all been deception, it might have been one part deception, one part goal setting mixed in with clearly that there were so many factors impacting what happened. Um I think the big difference between Theranos and story and some of the other uh stories about Silicon Valley where people promised a lot more than they could deliver is they were promising things that were directly related to health and health care. People were taking blood tests with the understanding that the data they were getting was important information about sexually transmitted diseases and other diseases and, and making real world decisions on the basis of that. Whereas if you remember when the iphone first came out, uh, Steve Jobs was still alive and the phones were dropping calls if you held it in a particular way. And his response was a little flip. He said it's, hey, folks, it's a phone as if, like, don't get so worked up. But people held him understandably to a very high standard, you know, she would sort of, it seemed, and I don't know because I certainly wasn't, there seemed like she sort of adopted this idea that you could get it wrong a bunch of times before you get it right. if the allegations are true and I think they, she was found guilty, I believe on a number of counts that a number of the things that they were doing were, were impacting real world decision making. So, Steve's point about the phone is just a phone., it depends on the call. If you're calling 911, then it's not just a phone, right. Um, but in the case of blood tests and disease, you know, that's, that's serious. I think that the Theranos case was super interesting to me because of the number of people from major universities and from government that both trusted her and the number of people who did not trust her and yet either didn't speak up or no one listened to them. It was only in the forensic version of it that everyone said, oh, yeah, I knew that she was lying, et cetera, et cetera. They were lying. are multiple people involved in those lies, apparently. But I have a deep interest in the neuroscience of, of narcissism, sociopathy and some of the darker aspects of the mind. So, yeah, maybe someday, maybe we'll do a podcast together and be like in the, in the, in the kind of early nineties version of talk shows where we darken the lights and we we do it together. You can use your voice because your voice is much more sinister sounding than mine."
