  "Text": "isn't just one but at the, at least at in the top five is or at least be good at autonomic self regulation. Know how to calm yourself down. expect the like looking to anything external to soothe yourself is it puts you in a terrible position to, to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right? So learn how to self soothe, right? Learn how to calm your mind, steady your actions, steady your voice. There are tools to do that we talked about on the podcast but elsewhere have that in place. I also think that if, your main focus is on you wanna have good boundaries, et cetera, but on tending to the relationship, doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do if everyone does that. It, it goes great. I mean, I'm sometimes so positively struck by how supported I feel., because for many years I was just kind of doing everything on my own. So, any little thing I'm like, oh, my goodness, this feels huge. Um, and also I think the dynamics have to be right. Let's, let's be really honest. This is a little bit of a tricky topic. But um is a power dynamic in relationships, sometimes not all, but in some relationships, it works much better if one person leads and the other person follows in other relationships. It's more mutuality works best people need to know what they need. And so knowing what you need and what you crave is really important. And then once you do that, you can create the relationship you want. I've seen that over and over again and people are different. Um But I think that, um, I mean, right, it's, it's, there's the dopamine phase of a relationship and then there's the serotonin phase, the kind of more mutuality, coziness and sweetness. There's a great book about how to make sure that the dopamine component and the serotonin component, so to speak, go on forever. And it has to do with, you know, when you first meet someone, you're attracted to them, you're essentially them. You meaning not in the way people might think you are not dependent on them for emotional stability or survival as you get close with somebody, you really come to depend on them and then you tend to objectify them less. And so this book, the book is uh the name is kind of corny. But the book, it's written by an analyst. Again, it's called Can Love Last. And it's a book about how really good strong relationships are the consequence of people constantly moving through this dependency objectification dynamic. And I use those words in the true, the psychological sense, not in the way they're typically thrown around nowadays. So the, you know, in some cultures, men and women will only touch for two weeks out of the month and then for the other two weeks, excitement and the sensuality and all, and the sexuality is very heightened then they go back to this kind of distancing. Now, I don't think that's feasible for most people. But if you look, statistically, those relationships tend to last a very long time with at least reported mutual feelings of intense attraction for many, many, many decades. So human beings need to learn how to at least understand and control these dynamics. And there's a lot of divorce, there's a lot of cheating, there's a lot of stuff out there. It'd be great if people could resolve some of this stuff inside of the relationship, in my opinion."
