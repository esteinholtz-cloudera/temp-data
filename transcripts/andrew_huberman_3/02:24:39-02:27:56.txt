  "Text": ". of all, we have to distinguish between modulators and mediators. And I'll do this very briefly. are a lot of things that will modulate your state of focus, but they don't directly mediate your sense of focus. So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off in this building, it would modulate our attention, we would get up and leave. It would be very hard to do what we're doing with that banging in the background, at least at first. it's modulating focus, but it's not really involved in the mechanisms of focus, right, the same way, being well rested. When you sleep, your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states of alertness and focus and calm works better than when you're sleep deprived. So if you're sleeping better, you're gonna focus better. So I always answer this way uh to a question like this because the best thing that anyone can do for their mental health, physical health and performance in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors is to make sure that you're getting enough quality sleep, of the time for you. And that's gonna differ, we could talk about what that means. Now, in terms of things that mediate focus without getting the description of mechanisms because we have podcasts about that. very clear that mental focus follows visual focus provided that you're a sighted person. of the training that's being done now in China, to teach kids to focus better, literally has them stare at a target blinking every so often, but really training themselves to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture. you read, you have to maintain a tight visual aperture, you're literally scrolling like a highlighter in your mind's eye, right? It's kind of obvious once you hear it. So for people that have problems focusing sleep, well, to dilate and contract your visual field consciously, this can be done if you practice it a little bit and then be as I said before, it is very hard to get into a state of focus like a step function immediately like snapping your fingers. What you can do is you can pick any object, but ideally an object at roughly the same distance, it roughly the same distance to which you're going to do that work and stare at it, you're allowed to blink and as your mind starts to drift every once in a while to understand that's normal, but try and narrow your visual aperture and bring that into your visual field. So that that's the most prominent thing kind of like portrait mode in your phone. This would look very different in portrait mode than it would in just a standard photograph mode. And then after doing that for 30 to 60 seconds moving into the work that you're about to do and really encourage yourself to do that. you're somebody who's low vision or no vision, you're gonna use your ears to do. This. Braille readers have trouble focusing sometimes because they feel other stuff and they hear other stuff. So you, you learn to adjust that aperture consciously. And then of course, there are the pharmacologic tools just enough caffeine but not too much, right? Um We talked about white noise, brown noise music or no music really varies, but it's very clear that Binaural beats of 40 Hertz shift the brain into a heightened state of focus and cognition. So if you're going to use Binaural beats, which should definitely be used with um headphones and there are a number of free apps out there in sources. Uh 40 Hertz seems to be the frequency that best supports the brain shifting into a particular."
