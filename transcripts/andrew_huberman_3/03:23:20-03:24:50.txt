  "Text": "also have to be careful. You know, I get a lot of questions from God. You have to be careful, the questions you ask in a relationship too. You have to make sure you really want that information and it's not just about people's past, right? If you ask somebody how they really feel about something about you and they tell you may be soothing, it may be intensely stressful, you have to be. Here's one thing I know for sure. For a relationship to work, you have to be brave. can't go in there fully protected and yet you also can't go in there with no boundaries because you'll end up beat up. What's that quote? If you want to be a warrior prepared to get hurt. If you want to be an explorer prepared to get lost. And if you want to be both, you know, and if you become a lover prepared to beat both or something, something like that, I forget. This is one of these Instagram type things that you see passing by and you go, oh, it's pretty true love. Love is scary because it takes us back to that primitive circuitry that is as primitive and basic as hunger, thirst, desire for heat when we're cold, the desire for cold, when we're overly uh warm, it's a, it's Dynorphin. I mean, when somebody leaves like the, uh you know, when somebody you were attached to leaves by death or by decision or you're forced apart, the Dynorphin release is a massive, it is true discomfort. People feel anxiety and discomfort moving through. That is a, a hell of a process. I mean, if I knew how to best break up at a neurological level or if you could just plug yourself into a wall and reset, I mean, I, I'd do that episode tomorrow, but we don't have that knowledge."
