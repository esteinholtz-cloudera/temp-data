  "Text": ", I'm very suspicious of our ability to find these intelligences out there and to find these earth like radio waves, for example, are, are terrible, their power drops off as basically one of our square. So remember reading that our current radio waves would not be uh the ones that we we are broadcasting would not be uh measurable by our devices today only like was it like 1/10 of a light year away? Like not even basically tiny distance because you really need like a targeted transmission of massive power directed somewhere for this to be picked up on long, long distances. so I just think that our ability to measure is um is not amazing. I think there's probably other civilizations out there. And then the big question is why don't they build Bino probes and why don't they interstellar travel across the entire galaxy? And my current answer is, it's probably interstellar travel is like really hard. Uh You have the interstellar medium, if you want to move at close to speed of light, you're going to be encountering bullets along the way because even like tiny hydrogen atoms and little particles of dust are basically have like massive kinetic energy at those speeds. so basically, you need some kind of shielding, you need, you have all the cosmic radiation. Uh It's just like brutal out there. It's really hard. And so my thinking is maybe interstellar travel is just extremely hard. You have"
