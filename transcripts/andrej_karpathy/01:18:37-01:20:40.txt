  "Text": "? I would say by far in the industry, if you're like talking about the industry and how, what is the technology of what we have available? Everything is supervised learning. So you need a data sets of input, desired output and you need lots of it. And um there are three properties of it that you need, you need it to be very large, you need it to be accurate, no mistakes. And you need it to be diverse. You don't want to just have a lot of correct examples of one thing you need to really cover the space of possibility as much as you can. And the more you can cover the space of possible inputs, the better the algorithm will work at the end. Now, once you have really good data sets that you're collecting, curating, um and cleaning, you can train your neural net um on top of that. So a lot of the work goes into cleaning those data sets. Now, as you pointed out, it's probably it could be. The question is how do you achieve a ton of uh you want to basically predict in 3D, you need data in 3D to back that up. So in this video, we have eight videos coming from all the cameras of the system and this is what they saw and this is the truth of what actually was around. There was this car, there was this car, this car, these are the lane line markings, this is the geometry of the road, there was a traffic light in this three dimensional position. need the ground truth. Um And so the big question that the team was solving of course is how do you, how do you arrive at that ground truth? Because once you have a million of it and it's large, clean and diverse then training a neural method on it works extremely well, and you can ship that into the car. And uh so there's many mechanisms by which we collected that training data. Uh You can always go for human an you can go for simulation as a source of grunt truth. You can also go for what we call the offline tracker um we've spoken about at the A ID and so on, which is basically an automatic reconstruction process for taking those videos and uh recovering the three dimensional sort of reality of what was around that car. So basically think of doing like a three dimensional reconstruction as an offline thing and then uh understanding that OK, there's 10 seconds of video, this is what we saw. And therefore, here's all the lane lines, cars and so on. then once you have that annotation, you can train neural nut to imitate it."
