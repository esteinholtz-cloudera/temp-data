  "Text": "written, basically, I think the community is very well able to peer review things very quickly on Twitter. I think maybe it just has to do something with A I machine learning field specifically though I feel like things are more easily auditable. Um And uh the verification is is easier potentially than the verification somewhere else. it's kind of like, um, you can think of these scientific publications as like little blockchains where everyone's building on each other's work and setting each other and you sort of have a I, which is kind of like this much faster and loose Blockchain. But then you have, and any one individual entry is like very, um, very cheap to make and then you have other fields where maybe that model doesn't make as much sense. Um so I think in a, I at least things are pretty easily verifiable. And so that's why when people upload papers, they are a really good idea and so on. Uh people can try it out like the next day and they can be the final arbiter of whether it works or not on their problem and the whole thing just moves significantly faster. I kind of feel like academia still has a place. So this like conference journal process still has a place, but it's sort of like, and um it lags behind I think and it's a bit more, maybe higher quality process, but it's not sort of the place where you will discover cutting edge work anymore. It used to be the case when I was starting my phd that you go to conferences and journals and you the latest research. Now when you go to a conference or a journal, like no one discusses anything that's there because it's already like three generations ago, irrelevant."
