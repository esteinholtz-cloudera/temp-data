  "Text": ". I think you mentioned like they pre map all the environments and they need to refresh the map and they have a perfect centimeter level accuracy map of everywhere they're going to drive. It's crazy how are you going to, been talking about autonomy, actually changing the world. We're talking about the deployment the on the global scale of autonomous systems for transportation. And if you need to maintain a centimeter accurate map for earth or like for many cities and keep them updated, it's a huge dependency that you're taking on huge dependency. it's a massive massive dependency. And now you need to ask yourself, do you really need it? humans don't need it? Um Right. So it's, it's very useful to have a low level map of like OK, the connectivity of your road, you know that there's a fork coming up. Uh When you drive an environment, you sort of have that high level understanding. It's like a small Google map. And Tesla uses Google map, like similar kind of resolution information in the system, but it will not pre map environments to send me, send me a level of accuracy. It's a crutch, it's a distraction, it costs entropy and it diffuses the team, it dilutes the team and you're not focusing on what's actually necessary, which is vision problem."
