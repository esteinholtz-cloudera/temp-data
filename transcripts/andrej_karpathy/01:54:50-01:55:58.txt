  "Text": "think it's a very hard project. I think it's going to take a while. But who else is going to build human robots at scale? And I think it is a very good form factor to go after because like I mentioned that the world is designed for human form factor, things would be able to operate our machines, they would be able to sit down in chairs, uh potentially even drive cars. Uh Basically, the world is designed for humans. That's the form factor you want to invest into and make work over time. Uh I think, you know, there's another school of thought which is OK, pick a problem and design a robot to it, but actually designing a robot and getting a whole data engine and everything behind it to work is actually an incredibly hard problem. So it makes sense to go after general interfaces that uh OK, they, they are not perfect for any one given task, but they actually have the generality just with a prompt with English able to do something across. And so I think it makes a lot of sense to go after a general uh interface um in the physical world. And I think it's a very difficult project, it is going to take time. Um But I see no other, no other company that can execute on that vision. I think it's going to be amazing. Like uh basically physical labor. Like if you think transportation is a large market, try physical labor, it's insane,"
