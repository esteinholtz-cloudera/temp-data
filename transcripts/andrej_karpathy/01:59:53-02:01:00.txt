  "Text": "nice. think it's going to take a long time. But the way you want to structure the development is you, you need to say, OK, it's going to take a long time. How can I set up the uh product development road map so that I'm making revenue along the way, I'm not setting myself up for a 01 loss function where it doesn't work until it works. You don't want to be in that position. You want to make it useful almost immediately and then you want to slowly deploy it uh and uh at scale at scale and you want to set up your data engine, your improvement loops the telemetry, the evaluation, the harness and everything. and you want to improve the product over time incrementally and you're making revenue along the way, that's extremely important because otherwise you cannot build these, these uh large undertakings just like, don't make sense economically. And also from the point of view of the team working on it, they need the dopamine along the way. They're not just going to make a promise about this being useful. This is going to change the world in 10 years when it works. This is not where you want to be. You want to be in a place like I think auto poti today where it's offering increased uh safety and um uh convenience of driving today, people pay for it. People like it, people purchase it and then you also have the greater mission that you're working towards"
