  "Text": "it's not just physical labor. To me, the thing that's also exciting is the social robotics. So the relationship we have on different levels with those robots. That's why I was really excited to see optimists. Like people have criticized me for the excitement. But I've worked with a lot of research labs that do humanoid legged robots, Boston Dynamics Unit a lot. There's a lot of companies that do legged robots, but the the elegance of the movement is a tiny, tiny part of the big picture. So integrating the two big exciting things to me about Tesla doing humanoid or any legged robots is integrating into the data engine. So the data engine aspect. So the actual intelligence for the perception and the control and the planning and all that kind of stuff integrating into the fleet that you mentioned, right? And then speaking of fleet, the second thing is the mass manufacturers just knowing culturally, driving towards a simple robot that's cheap to produce at scale and doing that well, having experience to do that well, that changes everything. That's why that's a very different culture and style than Boston dynamics. Who by the way, those robots are just the way they move it. It'll be a very long time before Tesla could achieve the smoothness of movement. But that's not what it's about., it's about uh it's about the entirety of the system, like we talked about the data engine and the fleet and that's super exciting even the initial sort of models. Uh But that too was really surprising that in a few months, you can get a, a prototype."
