  "Text": ". Well, the universal interface in the digital realm, I would say and there's a universal interface in like the physical realm, which in my mind is a humanoid form factor kind of thing. We can later talk about optimist and so on. But I feel like there's a uh kind of like a similar philosophy in some way where the human, the world, the physical world is designed for the human form and the digital world is designed for the human form of seeing the screen and using keyword, not keyboard and mouse. And so it's the un universal interface that can uh basically uh command the digital infrastructure we've built up for ourselves. And so it feels like a very powerful interface to, to command and to build on top of uh now, to your question as to like what I learned from that, it's interesting because world of bits was basically uh too early, I think at open a at the time, this is around 2015 or so. And the zeitgeist at that time was very different in A I from the zeitgeist today. At the time, everyone was super excited about reinforcement learning from scratch. This is the time of the Atari paper uh where uh neural networks were playing Atari games um and beating humans in some cases, uh Alphago and so on. So everyone's very excited about train training neural networks from scratch using reinforcement learning. Um directly, turns out that reinforcement learning is extremely inefficient way of training neural networks because you're taking all these actions and all these observations and you get some sparse rewards once in a while. So you do all this stuff based on all these inputs. And once in a while you're like told you did a good thing, you did a bad thing and it's just an extremely hard problem. You can't learn from that. Uh you can burn a forest and you can sort of brute force through it. And we saw that I think with uh you know, with uh go and do and so on and does work. but it's extremely inefficient uh and uh not how you want to approach problems. Uh Practically speaking. And so that's the approach that at the time, we also took to a world of bits. Uh we would uh have an agent initialize randomly. So with keyboard mash and mouse mash and try to make a booking and it's just like revealed the insanity of that approach very quickly where you have to stumble by the correct booking in order to get a reward of you did it correctly and you're never going to stumble by it by chance at random."
