  "Text": ". It's like a little bit of a wrong question because basically you would think that these sensors are an asset to you. But if you fully consider the entire product in its entirety, sensors are actually potentially a liability because the sensors aren't free. They don't just appear on your car. You need suddenly you have an entire supply chain, you have people procuring it, there can be problems with them. They may need replacement. They are part of the manufacturing process, they can hold back the line in production. Uh You need to source them, you need to maintain them. You have to have teams that ride the firmware, all of the, all of it. And then you also have to incorporate and fuse them into the system in some way. And so it actually like bloats the or the a lot of it. I think Elon is really good at simplify, simplify. Best part is no part and he always tries to throw away things that are not essential because he understands the entropy in organizations and an approach. And I think uh in this case, cost is high and you're not potentially seeing it if you're just a computer vision engineer and I'm just trying to improve my network. And you know, is it more useful or less useful? How, how useful is it? And the thing is that once you consider the full cost of a sensor, it actually is potentially a liability. And you need to be really sure that it's giving you extremely useful information. In this case, we looked at using it or not using it and the delta was not massive. And so it's not useful is it"
