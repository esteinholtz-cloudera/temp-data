  "Text": "data engine is what I call the almost biological feeling like process by which you are perfect the training sets for these neural networks. Um So, because most of the programming now is in the level of these data sets and make sure they're large, diverse and clean basically have a data set that you think is good, you train your neural net, you deploy it and then you observe how well it's performing. And you're trying to uh always increase the quality of your data set. So you're trying to catch scenarios basically that are basically rare. And uh it is in these scenarios that general nets will typically struggle in because they weren't told what to do in those rare cases in the data set. But now you can close the loop because if you can now collect all those at scale, you can then feed them back into the reconstruction process I described uh reconstruct the truth in those cases and add it to the data set. And so the whole thing ends up being like a staircase of improvement of perfecting your training set and you have to go through deployments so that you can mine uh the parts that are not yet represented well in the data set. So your data set is basically imperfect. It needs to be diverse, it has pockets that are missing and you need to pad out the pockets. You can sort of think of it that way the data."
