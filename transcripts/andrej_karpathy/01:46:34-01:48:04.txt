  "Text": "just like thinking about it long enough, like studying looking at sample data, like you said, driving my intuition is really flawed on this. Like I don't have a good intuition about tractability. It could be, it could be anything it could be solvable. Like uh you know, the driving task could be simplified into something quite trivial. Like the solution to the problem would be quite trivial. And at scale more and more cars driving perfectly make the problem much easier than the more cars you have driving. Like people learn how to drive correctly, not correctly, but in a way that's more optimal for a heterogeneous system of autonomous and semi-autonomous and manually driven cars that could change stuff. Then again, also, I've spent a ridiculous number of hours just staring at pedestrians, crossing streets thinking about humans and it feels like the way we use our eye contact, sends really strong signals and there's certain quirks and edge cases of behavior. And of course, a lot of the fatalities that happen have to do with drunk driving and um both on the pedestrian side and the driver side. So there's that problem of driving at night and all that kind of. So I wonder, you know, it's like the space possible solution to autonomous driving includes so many human factor issues it's almost impossible to predict it. There could be super clean, nice solutions."
