  "Text": "do. Yeah. And especially when you get into the details of it, I used to think origin of life was very um, it was this magical rare event but then you read books like for example, Nickle um uh the vital question, life ascending etcetera. And he really gets in and he really makes you believe that this is not that rare, basic chemistry, you have an active earth and you have your alkaline vents and you have lots of alkaline water mixing with a de ocean and you have your proton gradients and you have the little porous pockets of these alkaline vents that concentrate chemistry. um basically, as he steps through all of these little pieces, you start to understand that actually, this is not that crazy. You could see this happen on other systems. Um And he really takes you from just a geology to primitive life and he makes it feel like it's actually pretty plausible and also like uh the origin of life um uh was actually fairly fast after formation of earth. Um I, if I remember correctly, just a few 100 million years or something like that after basically, when it was possible, life actually arose. And so that makes me feel like that is not the constraint. Uh that is not the limiting variable and that life should actually be fairly common. Um And then, you know, where the drop offs are, is, is very, um is very interesting to think about., I currently think that there's no major drop offs basically. And so there should be quite a lot of life and basically what it, where that brings me to then is the only way to reconcile the fact that we haven't found anyone and so on is that um we just can't, we can't see them, we can't observe them just a quick brief"
