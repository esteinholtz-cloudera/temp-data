  "Text": "people who are seasoned? Like they actually like going past life?, I hated it. I would make sure I was really good at making my needle float. I didn't want to have some auditor because I never believed in the past life memories. I don't want to be in that impassable, you know, reach an impasse in an auditing session where I was being asked for something I couldn't provide because I knew this auditing session has to end on a good point. But Scientologists enjoy for the most part going. They call it whole track. Whole track is past life. Going whole track your time track. They call it the time track is your whole memory, but whole track refers to anything past life. So going whole track or deep whole track, reality, meaning it's not like, oh, I have a fuzzy memory and I'm not sure if it's real like your real season. Scientologists are like, oh yeah, I was on this planet at this time circling this, this was what I was eating for breakfast."
