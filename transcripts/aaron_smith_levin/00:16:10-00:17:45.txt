  "Text": "you look at the, let's take one of the worst places on earth is North Korea. You have Kim Jong Un the reality is there's a lot of citizens of that nation that deeply love the leader they've grew up in that way. And you, I mean, through fear, through all kinds of manipulation through propaganda and so on. They're not allowed to love members of their own family. They're not allowed to have romantic love. They're only allowed to have love for the leader and to reach those people, you have to empathize with the fact that in their eyes, in some sense, this is a great man. This is a God, a Messianic figure. You can't just make fun of the ridiculousness of the situation that this this pudgy person around creating propaganda. Like how is this with the funny haircut? Like it's so easy Hitler too to make fun of, to make a caricature of the person. But this is a real person, a real person that influenced the minds of millions of people in the case of Hitler, tens of millions of people and created a huge amount of suffering, not because of um caricature version, but because he was a charismatic leader, he was somebody that people deeply, deeply loved and that just over time, I mean, with the abuse of any kind of ideology, this this happens over and over. And so yeah, it's, it's interesting because scientology is so close to the to, to, to the core of what is America because so many Americans are involved with it. So it's interesting to study the, the beauty and the power of the ideas that underlie it and where things go wrong."
