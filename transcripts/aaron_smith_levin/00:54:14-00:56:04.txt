  "Text": "that what you've just described, it could be an identical description of what it feels like and what it means to go up Scientology. Break of total freedom. You are reinforcing to yourself that everything's getting better and better and better and, and you'd be like, don't spend time with your family anymore. You're broke, even though you make a lot of money. You're always stressed. You're at the beck and call of these people who seem to run your lives. Like how a scientologist feels about their own life is, um, very interesting to compare that to how that person's life looks to their non Scientology. Family members. I get contacted by a lot of people who've never been in Scientology, but I got a family member who's really deep. And can you help me understand some things? Why is this person's life like this? Why is this person's life like this? I, I don't want to say that Scientologists do not actually, I don't want to say, oh, it's all in their heads. They think they're being helped, but they're really not, that doesn't feel honest, you know, but it's this thing where if Scientology was just auditing you wanted the subjects you wanted and you could take it or leave it, that would be fine. It's, it's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization and this entire experience has as a part of that experience, taking everything from you, demanding everything from you, controlling who you can speak with, controlling who you can have relationships with who you have to erase from your life. This is where and it's hard to, it's hard to place one pinpoint on this is where Scientology goes wrong. It's really hard to do that because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology."
