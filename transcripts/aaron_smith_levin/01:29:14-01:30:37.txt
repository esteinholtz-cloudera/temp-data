  "Text": "is the only thing that matters. So let's say, let's say if Shelley was married to Dave, but she worked in a different organization, would never be seen with him ever publicly, ever. Wouldn't travel with him, wouldn't go to events with him. Nothing around 2006, 2007. And I'm very oversimplifying this. Ok, Shelley basically pissed off Dave to the point where he's like, ok, I'm done with you. I'm going to take you off of your post. Ok. that point, she was reassigned to another confidential scientology base up in uh Twin Peaks, California. Why am I? The reason I'm providing this type of detail is because we hear that Shelley's missing. Yeah. Ok. Well, you realize the same people who report that Shelley's missing are also the same people who will tell you exactly where she is.. She works at this secretive CST Church of spiritual technology base out in Twin Peaks, California. I have personal confirmation that she was seen and spoken with by someone who knew her well in, I'll say 2019, Shelly Miscavige is missing in the sense that hasn't been seen with David Miscavige since about 2006. But because she's no longer his assistant, would never see her with him"
