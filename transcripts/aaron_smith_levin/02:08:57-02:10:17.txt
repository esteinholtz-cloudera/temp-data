  "Text": "Yeah, you, my episode on the Lee Remedy in the aftermath show talking about me and my twin brother. just a pretty horrible story. It's just a pretty horrible story. So I do have a younger brother who's still in Scientology and disconnected from me, but I never had much of a relationship, um, with that brother. Um, to begin with. Right. Um, but my twin brother died when I was like, 23 or 24. that was without any question, a direct result of, um, Scientology experience, you know, he died in a car accident that wasn't technically his fault or anything like he wasn't even the one driving. But uh fact the, the specific fact of his death was not meaning like the, the, the fact and the manner of his death and time wasn't like specifically because of scientology. But our story and how uh where our relationship got to how he was even in a position having something like that happen to him is directly attributable to scientology."
