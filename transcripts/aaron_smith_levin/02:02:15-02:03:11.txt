  "Text": "is the one way they effectively put their money to use is lobbying attorneys. Um, you know, judges very rarely have they ever, ever been able just to get a politician on their side. It's the behind the scenes people, you know, Greta Van Susteren is a very high level, long term scientologist and her husband. I always get it wrong. It's either Jim Cole or John Cole, I always get it wrong. Uh, he's a very powerful attorney who has a lot uh wields a lot of influence behind the scenes. that's just one example, like the reason why, that's an interesting example is because he's actually a scientologist and he travels in those circles. Scientology though, it's money goes to good use by hiring non scientologists, retired judges, attorneys, lobbyists. It really is how they get almost anything done. Like Miscavige himself is not hobnobbing and glad hand and shaking hands and meeting these folks. It's the non scientologist professionals who work behind the scenes on Scientology's behalf."
