  "Text": ". it's one of the reasons I like putting up content on my channel. So they can see, hey, like if you're a Scientologist, you look at it and you go, hey, he seems like he's doing well. He's, he's happy, he's a positive guy. He's a good communicator. He knows what he's talking about. He's not lying. He's not exaggerating. I don't exaggerate anything on my channel. I don't make up anything. this is actually comes from an experience I had from 1998 to 2000 I was living in LA, I sort of had a two year period in my life where I actually had almost no contact with Scientology. during that time I found my way onto the internet and there was a website, it might have been ESMBX Scientology message, but whatever it was, it was at that time, the main source of critical information about Scientology on the internet. And I looked at it, I remember I was still a true believer I looked at this and it was so offensive, insulting, hyperbolic, exaggerated. I was like, oh, just a bunch of bullshit. was in Scientology for 16 more years. I had seen on the internet about critical of Scientology. If what I had seen when I had seen it was something that actually resonated with me I was like, oh, I believed was true. That seemed credible. I would have gotten out of Scientology 16 years earlier. So I was like, can I help create an experience on the internet that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it, it will resonate with them instead of repelling them. And that is exactly what I have set out to do and what I believe I've accomplished."
