  "Text": "is from L Ron Hubbard. And then after you finish OT five, you get rid of all the BT clusters. Ot six is just a training course to teach you how to audit OT seven. Well, ot seven is now more BT S except it's in the environment stuff. You're trying to locate BT S, you can find them on your body, but it's just more BT S.? And then OT eight is, remember we talked about in all these auditing sessions throughout the entire Scientology Bridge. You have people who've run hundreds or thousands of past life, whole track incidents. These memories have become part of their self identity of who they even think they are. Ot eight, you go through all these past life recalls and essentially, I'm oversimplifying this a little bit. He goes psych all those past life memories weren't yours. They were your BT S he goes now that you've discovered this now, you know who you are not you are ready to find out who you really are., now you're supposed to find out who you really are on ot nine and 10, those don't exist,"
