  "Text": "often does. you combine that with the fact that Scientology is against any forms of mental health or health outside of Scientology. And you have a recipe for disaster. Now, you might go, where did all these spirits come from that are stuck to your body. This is where Xu comes into play. So Hubbard says that 75 million ago, Xu uh was basically um a dictator at uh the galactic Confederation is like 70 something or 80 something planets somewhere in the milky way. And uh Xu was like uh a dictator and overlord for either one of these planets or the whole system and they had a population problem and Xu was like, we need to get rid of like half the people. So we called them all in for tax audits. Hubbard didn't like the IRS. So of course, the story has to do with tax audits, ok? Called them all in for tax audits said psych bitches froze them in gly call, loaded them up on space planes, flew them to earth. Remember the story has to be earth because the story is what's wrong with us, flew them to earth, dropped them in volcanoes, blew them up with hydrogen bombs and then captured them with like spirit magnets. I'm making up words because, ok, and these disembodied spirits of these people that got blown up have just been blown in the wind here on earth and they attach themselves to things and they can be in the environment and they stick to bodies and everything. And so, and they all have reactive minds. So at Scientology's upper levels, if you get sick or you have cancer or there's something wrong with you. Scientology will say one of your body things. You need to get some auditing to fix the body thing. So this"
