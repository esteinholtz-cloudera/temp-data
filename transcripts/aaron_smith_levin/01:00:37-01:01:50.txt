  "Text": "I got to tell you it's one of the reasons I do my youtube channel. It's one of the reasons I decided to upload every day. I've uploaded every day for the last six months. I just wanted there to be a nonstop flow of information of any kind in any variety long as it's fair and balanced, intelligent, interesting that Scientologists who stumble upon the internet will go, oh, look, someone's talking about my thing. Let's see what they got going on., and I know this guy, the fact that Scientology crushes so much information. But before, before youtube before, like I have the only like big Scientology channel and that only got big in the last six months. OK. So before that there were channels, there was things but it's almost like it took a lot of uh like people, felt like it had took a lot of bravery and courage to say something on the internet about Scientology and so people would pop up and there weren't very many voices and I was like, I want this to be prolific. I want, I want to be prolific. I want to have 30 or 40 other channels being prolific. So that Scientology couldn't possibly control the narrative about it. Have you been personally attacked? Aaron smith.com is a website created by the Church of Scientology. Have you seen it?"
