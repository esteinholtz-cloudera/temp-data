  "Text": "moments would equal the darkest moment. It, it would be that also just the period of, you know,, 12 months of impending doom, that my wife's whole family was gonna be obliterated that there's nothing we could do about it., uh, kind of telling ourselves every step of the way it wasn't really gonna happen, know, I really felt like ever watch the Ozarks, I felt like Marty Burden. Now this was happening before the Ozarks. But when I watched the Ozarks I see that character, entire world is crumbling down around him and all he can do like, all right, what's the next step? I watch Marty Bird and I go, that's my fucking spirit animal you can only control what you can control. um you can't keep Scientology from destroying your family and, and literally, like, I, it's funny, I, I mentioned this show a lot because I watched that and I go like that's exactly how I felt. You know, I talk about this six months or nine or 12 months, whatever it was of impending doom. It's not like I was an emotional wreck during that time, you know, in private, I was, but it's not like I was just freaking out. It was like the sun's gonna come up tomorrow, the world's gonna keep spinning. can't control it. This is hard. I can't believe this is happening, tomorrow is a new day. I've never, personally, even at the darkest times I've never experienced anything that I would characterize as depression. Certainly not ever any suicidal thoughts or anything. And even in the darkest of times. I, and again, there's one thing that I go, is it because of Scientology or is it just me? There really is an emotional detachment. almost has to be."
