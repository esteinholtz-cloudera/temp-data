  "Text": "was how the family was gonna be destroyed and trying to prevent that. I was terrified of that happening, it happened. nothing left to be afraid of and that's kind of the thing like they created this beast. And the same is true for Mark Headley. The same is true for Mike Rinder. I I said they've essentially created a scientology proof virus, scientology resistant strain by throwing everything they have at us for so many years. They have just through natural selection, people who just do not give a damn about anything they could or would do. And maybe there is something a little wrong with me because when I get a phone call from someone like I just got this phone call about you and it's clear that it's Scientology P I is doing work behind the scenes. I get really excited. I get really excited. I don't get nervous. I'm going, oh no, what's happening? I'm like, oh yeah, this is going to be exciting. I'm like, ok, because everything they try to do to me, going to figure out how to reflect it back on them and make them look ridiculous."
