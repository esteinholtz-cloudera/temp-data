  "Text": "is a belief system created by LR Hubbard does fundamentally believe that we are all immortal spiritual beings called phaetons we have native godlike potential. That there is nothing more powerful in the universe than a Thean like so godlike is, you know, quite literal here. that through various decisions Satans have made, they have fallen away from their native godlike power uh fallen down to a state where most Satans aren't even aware that they are. Satans aren't even aware that they ever have lived before or have these powers and that Satans are now in a state where they're trapped in bodies trapped here on earth, uh trapped in this prison of a physical universe, trapped on this prison of a planet. that only Scientology can restore a thing to its native state."
