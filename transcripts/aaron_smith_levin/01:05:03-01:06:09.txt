  "Text": "let me show you. So here's what's happening here. We just hired some day laborers off of what like Craigslist or something. what Scientology did was they had a private investigator stake out the the house flip project. They were clearly running license plates of anyone who visited the property because otherwise otherwise, how would they find out the laborers names? Look, do background checks on them to find out they had criminal records and they published this as if it's gonna reflect negatively on me. Oh, we hired someone to do work who had a criminal record who gives a shit. you know one of the biggest problems people with records have is finding employment. There's nothing bad about hiring someone who's got a criminal record. It doesn't reflect negatively on me, but it shows you what they think about those people. It shows you what they think about people who are trying to put their lives back together and maybe, you know, actually work for a living. And it also shows that they're serving, us, like, like they don't realize that putting this up, they're publishing information that they could only have if they're surveilling me and Mike and it doesn't occur to them. Maybe we shouldn't put that up."
