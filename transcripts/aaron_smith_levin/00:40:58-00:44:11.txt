  "Text": ". And you can give me any answer you want. There's no way for me to know if you're giving me the right answer. But I want you to give me something. If you say you can't give me anything, I'm going to keep using the email until you give me something. Ok? So let's say you give me something, gonna get all the details about that. And until like time place form an event, I want to know everything that happened. I want to know all the details and by the way, I'm writing all this down. So I'm taking notes of everything you're telling me that it's a bad thing that you did that you haven't told me about. Ok, so I'm keeping notes you represent to me that you've told me everything there is to tell I'm looking for the needle to give like a smooth back and forth motion like this. And Scientology calls that a floating needle that means in Scientology land, we're done with that. now I might go back to check the question. OK, good. I'll check the question again. Is there anything you're withholding from me? Oh, if I get another read, we gotta go through the process again. OK. If you tell me, I've told you everything and I don't get a floating needle, I've got to go. OK. Is there an earlier similar thing? Have you basically done an earlier, similar thing? Is there an earlier, similar time you haven't told someone something or is there an earlier similar thing to that you did? The thing that you just told me going to keep going earlier, similar earlier, similar earlier, similar until I get a floating needle? And that's where I'm explaining it. This way, you can see how no matter what the specific auditing session happens to be about. There's still the potential in any auditing session that you're going into past lives just because you have to go earlier similar until you get a floating needle. Ok. Now, here's how Scientologists think the E meter actually works. Meaning why does the E meter work? So we, we talked before about these um mental pictures, right? These recordings. Ok. Well, we spoke about N grams, just recordings of pain and unconsciousness. Well, scientology would hold the the bad recordings aren't the only recordings that you have. Those are just the recordings in your reactive mind. You also have an analytical mind which is just your conscious memory, conscious recording of everything from present time to the last 76 trillion years. Hubbard would say that these memories are actually a perfectly detailed recording and he says like 56 perceptions or something and that it's perfect and you can access that information, you just have trouble doing so. OK. So he says that these recordings, these mental pictures have actual electrical charge and mass. you asked before, is there any actual physics in this? I don't know, where are you supposed to store the pictures of your last 76 trillion years that have charging mass? don't see it, but Hubbard says it's there. OK. he says that these things have mass and when you recall them or put attention on them, you create an electrical flow which maybe through magnetic fields or whatever impinges upon the electrical flow of the E meter and it shows up as a read on the needle. That's how Scientology, that's how Scientologists believe that's why the needle reads. Now, Cynics would say the needle only reads on palm sweat movement. Well, I know that's not true. Mhm. Right. I, I can't tell you everything the needle does read on but I can tell you it's not just moving your hands and sweaty hands. It"
