  "Text": "right. That's right. I would probably argue that auditors are not in a position of having many crisis of faith because actually they're usually seeing people for the most part in some ways through the process of auditing. Now, auditing can create like a state, somewhat of a euphoric state. You feel great, you're just blown out of your head, you know, you feel on top of the world, I've had that in some of my auditing an auditor. Sorry. No, as a person receiving auditing. And so my point is that as an auditor doing a lot of auditing, you know, you're going to have someone in front of you called the precleared the person in front of you who's getting the auditing called the PC or the pre clear see over and over and over again. These P CS having these sort of euphoric states and floating needles and I feel great and fantastic. No, thanks. You saved my life and da da, da, da da, like I've always said, if scient, if people didn't find scientology helpful, nobody would ever stay in Scientology. Right. And so auditors are pretty much the ones doing the heavy lifting of what it even means to be a Scientologist. Those guys aren't the ones that you end up,, having a crisis of faith. I mean, doing Scientology auditing, it doesn't require that you believe, just have faith that you believe something. You just have to go through these motions and scientologists. One of the reasons scientologists think this is all scientific is because it's like, I don't care if you believe why this works. I care how you feel at the end of an auditing"
