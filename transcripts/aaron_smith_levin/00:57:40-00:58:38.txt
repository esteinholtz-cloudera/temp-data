  "Text": "really pushed this thing that, uh, you've been in a Scientology organization yourself, or unless you've actually been a Scientologist, you couldn't possibly know the truth about Scientology. If you're only getting information from people who aren't members or former members, then you couldn't possibly be getting the correct information. Now, they don't realize the math, there doesn't make sense. If you can find out the true information by becoming and being a Scientologist, that means you can get the correct information from a former Scientologist because they traveled that path and they got the correct information. So they still create this un, they try to create this unfalsifiable loop where, unless you are personally doing it, you don't have correct information and you go, what about the people who did personally do it? Got the correct information left are now sharing that with others. Well, no, those are lies. Well, ok. So, so just anything you don't like is a lie, then you go, yeah, pretty much. That's, it's kind of how it works."
