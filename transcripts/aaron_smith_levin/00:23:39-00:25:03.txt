  "Text": "scientology has this concept of the dynamics. Ron Hubbard breaks life into eight different dynamics and the dynamic meaning a thrust towards survival. So he would say, you know, the first dynamic is you yourself second dynamic is your family. Third dynamic is any other group that you're a part of other than your family? Fourth dynamic is all humankind. The fifth dynamic is plant and animal life, all nonhuman life. Uh Sixth dynamic is the physical world. Seventh dynamic is sort of like spirituality collectively, Satans us A Satans and the eighth dynamic. L. Ron Hubbard says scientology doesn't deal with the eighth dynamic, but we recognize that people have this idea of a supreme being. And so scientology says you can call the eighth dynamic, the supreme being dynamic, but we call it infinity, just the all of everything without having to define it. then they sort of do a little dance and they're like scientology. The purpose of Scientology is to get you to the point where you have your own understandings or realizations about the nature of the eighth dynamic. We don't tell you what you have to believe about that. And technically speaking, that is true. Technically speaking, that is true. There's no point in Scientology where they sit you down and say you're not required to revoke your belief in a supreme being. It's just that everything in Scientology is, is inconsistent with a belief in the supreme being. can still find scientologists who through cognitive dissonance will tell you they believe in a supreme being. Mostly they're lying to you."
