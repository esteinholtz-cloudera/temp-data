But the, the, the, the, the reason that's effective is you can kind of create conspiracy theories that create chaos and nobody knows what is true that bot farms can do but actually really nicely control a narrative. It's hard. So to create chaos, it's easier to do to basically say like you know, do pr control is very hard. Yeah.
