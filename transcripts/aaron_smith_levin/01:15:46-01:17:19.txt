  "Text": "this question by first connecting some dots. Yes. OK. We spoke early in the interview about achieving your native Godlike state that in Scientology is called native state. OK. Native state and full operating thean mean the exact same thing. OK. Because at native state, you are a fully operating the operating meaning operating in your full capacity. So ot means operating the, the upper confidential half of Scientology bridge are called the ot levels, the operating the levels and these and remember they're confidential. So most scientologists have not done these levels, they don't know what's on them. is on these levels that you learn about the Xu and the body Thean story. Can you describe Xu, please? We spoke earlier about how at the lower non confidential levels of Scientology's bridge Hubbard is saying that what's wrong with you is your reactive mind? Yes. Ok., in Scientology, once you've gotten rid of your reactive mind, that is what's called the state of clear. Ok. So after you finish state of clear, the next thing on the bridge is the ot levels. Well, if you've already gotten rid of your active mind, what the heck are you supposed to do now? Well, now L Ron Hubbard says,, first, what was wrong with you was just your reactive mind. But now the next thing you have to resolve, the next thing that's wrong with you is you actually have tens of thousands of Satans stuck to your body and they all have their own reactive minds. You have to audit the thons."
