  "Text": "would be correct. So what can make it challenging to and completely describe Scientology in the beginning is what Scientologists believe actually changes as they progress further into or further up in Scientology. So, um the explanation as I've given it is pretty consistent with what you would get at the lowest levels, right? You're a Thean, I'm a Satan. Everyone's a Thean we have a reactive mind. L Ron Hubbard would say the reactive mind is a collection of these recordings, mental recordings of any moments of pain and unconsciousness you've ever had in your life. It's like the subconscious mind. it's always recording in moments of pain and unconsciousness and that these are called, uh these recordings are called L Ron Hubbard, called them N grams. Now, when L Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in 1950 this was before Scientology came along a couple of years later, right? So in 1950 when he wrote Dianetics, wasn't a spiritual endeavor. It was supposed to be a mental health, a science of mental health., of that time, the earliest engram you could have was the incident of birth being born was an engram. uh technically in dianetics, they said you could have prenatal engrams like when you're still in the womb. But there was no concept of past lives as of 1950 version of dianetics, right? so the idea there was that the reactive mind is essentially a stimulus response mechanism created through evolution millions of years ago to protect the individual from things that would harm them. In other words, things that would bring about pain and unconsciousness. So you have these recordings of things that hurt you, create pain and unconsciousness. And in present time, these things will react upon you in a way to cause you to avoid similar things reacting upon you in a, in a subconscious unconscious way."
