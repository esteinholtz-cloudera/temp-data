  "Text": "you ask the question um where uh why would all these people hold on to their stories? They don't, they would never want to leak. Like by even who would want to leak would not even want to be a scientologist anymore. Like if you, if you truly believe in Scientology and you got your shoulder to the wheel and you're a sea or member, you think Scientology is literally the only thing that can save every being on this planet from a fate of eternal amnesia and slavery, right?

But you're a slave. That's how Scientologists see this planet. They actually, they, they refer to earth as a prison planet."
