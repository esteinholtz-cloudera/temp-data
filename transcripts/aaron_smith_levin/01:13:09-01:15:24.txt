  "Text": "definitely believes in that. I think he believes in Scientology but in a different way than all other Scientologists because he's aware of a lot more, damaging information about L Ron Hubbard and the true story of scientology than most people. So his version of belief is different. I'll give you one example here. So, Scientology Bridge to total freedom goes up to what they call OT eight operating thing in level eight. OK. Scientologists have all been told that L Ron Hubbard before he passed, finished, completed putting together ot 9 1011, 1213, 14 and 15, it's just sitting in the vault waiting to be released. is part of the Scientology belief system because remember I said growing up Scientology Bridge, a total freedom is how you're supposed to get back to your native Godlike state. While all the Scientologists in the world who've already done ot eight know that they haven't gotten there, but they still believe in Scientology because they're told there's more. But wait, there's more MCAT knows there is no more., Moskvich knows the fundamental promise of being able to achieve full operating. Thean is a lie. He knows L Ron Hubbard didn't accomplish that. So therefore, no one else is going to accomplish it as well. If L Ron Hubbard had accomplished it, MS Cage knows, well, he didn't write it up. He didn't leave instructions for how anyone else would accomplish it. So no matter what Miscavige knows the fundamental promise that s what Scientology is saying they will be able to deliver to mankind a lie. Now, it's going to sound like I'm contradicting myself because it sounds like I'm saying, well, he knows it's bullshit. think he believes that L Ron Hubbard just failed finish his work. And he's kind of hoping Al Ron Hubbard is going to come back to finish the job because L Ron Hubbard did tell the people at international the international management base, at least a core of them that he was coming back., we know that David Miscavige believed this because right around the 21 year mark, he was supposed to come back like 21 years after he died, right around the 21 year mark. David Miscavige was getting busy putting some things in place that had to get done in case Ron Hubbard came back. So we know he at least believed to that level. Do you"
