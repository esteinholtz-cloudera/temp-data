  "Text": "conversation about David Musk gets really interesting because I could give you if I wanted to make the argument that he didn't believe I could give you a dozen examples to make that argument. I just happen think that he believes in a different way. Whereas your average scientologist believes that Al Ron Hubbard was practically infallible that he thought of everything in advance. He took care of everything before he left and Miscavige still believes in like the main structure of this thing. But he's like, oh shit, it's falling to me to figure out how to actually make this thing happen., I think Miss Gage sees himself as someone who has to, a certain degree had to go back and fix all Ron Hubbard's mistakes."
