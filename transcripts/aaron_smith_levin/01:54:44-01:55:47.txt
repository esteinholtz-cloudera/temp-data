  "Text": "like this dark lesson of human nature that they like, there's something about, you know, to use the word cults that you just stop seeing reality for what it is. There's a lot of things that could make this a better organization that's actually helping people flourish and um, and be a little bit more like uh loose about membership, not dividing families, not causing suffering, not causing financial harm, but actually inspiring people and helping people. But then it maybe it fundamentally changes of what the organization is and maybe that means somebody like David Miscavige loses power too, which might be very difficult or people that are close to him lose power and people hold on to power. So, um, whatever the human forces here, it, it seems to worse and worse over time. What about, uh, oh, let me ask a conspiracy question. Is there a chance that Tom Cruise is being blackmailed that there's information from auditing? No, no. So that kind of stuff is not that"
