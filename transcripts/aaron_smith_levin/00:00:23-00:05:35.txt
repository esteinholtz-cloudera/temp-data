Uh They have a number of one meal kits for eating well, with options for keto, vegan, vegetarian fast and fit Mediterranean and gluten free. Of course, you know which one I pick? I'm still on keto. I'm still on carnivore. I jump around. I'm not, uh, religiously anyone diet, but I just feel much better when the number of carbs I consume is very low. And I should also say that I don't do cheap meals, which I think is a popular notion that a bunch of people follow. It just doesn't work for me. I enjoy life so much more when I, sort of cheat by having just a tiny bit of carbs, not like just pig out completely. So I guess cheat by like a, a quick little detour, a quick little glance, not a full on affair. If you know what I'm saying. Anyway, keto uh ridiculous but the keto meals from Green Chef is really, that's my go to, it's delicious. I really highly recommend it.

A service I use to track the data that comes from the biological system that some refer to as Alex Friedman, but I'm just a collection of cells. a underneath that, a collection of atoms. I'm a collection of a lot of things, billions, trillions. And somehow they're all in this one bag that move together, this meat vehicle that operates with other meat vehicles and meet space and does interesting things and is worried and is hopeful and uh is ecstatic, sometimes, sometimes is afraid at the end of the day, the ride ends too quickly for that meat bag guess others call Lex. But I don't even know what I call myself in my own head. am I even talking to you right now? What is this? A bunch of cells are firing, a thought, creating an experience of a thought. me in a better way discuss experience of a thought. here we are I'm speaking in a technology build by humans in a room, you human are now listening to this. is this? anyway, if you want to get a little data on this giant mystery, this beautiful mystery that is the biology of our human body, you should use inside tracker and you can get special savings for a limited time and you go to inside tracker.com/lex. show is also brought to you by athletic greens and it's a G one drink which is an all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance. take it twice a day, I take it after a run, long run in the now warm Texas weather slowly getting ready for that Texas heat. I mean, I love those long runs along the river. Um, anywhere I go just long runs along with my thoughts. When I'm listening to Brown Noise or an audiobook, just takes me away, takes me away for an hour or two or three depending on how long the run is. And just, I'm in a, in a different world and when I come back, come back into this world. The first entry point is an athletic greens drink. Sometimes I'll put it in the fridge and then take a quick shower and drink it cold. It's delicious either way, warm, cold doesn't matter. Just put a little powder with some water. It's magic. And I also, when I travel, I take it, gives me that feeling that I've gotten my life in order, at least for the nutritional stuff. They'll give you one month supply of fish oil.
