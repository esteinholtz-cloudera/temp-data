  "Text": "it soft corruption. So another example you have the mayor of Clearwater Frank Hibor. Well, he used to when he won his recent election, he stepped down from some of these nonprofits that he served on. But the nonprofits that he served on also gets millions of dollars of donations from some of Scientology's richest Clearwater members, right? You have one of the mayor's best friends, Joe Burdett, literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology. So that creates a chilling effect anyone who's gonna be talking smack about Scientology because friends are on their damn payroll. So um I call it soft corruption. It's not illegal, it's not illegal. Um But it's how Scientology wields influence and what's, what's, what's ironic is that a lot of these people who work on Scientology behalf actually secretly hate Scientology."
