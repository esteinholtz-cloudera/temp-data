  "Text": "? The final thing is when he got to a point where he was no longer being forced to lie, to protect L Ron Hubbard. He was now being forced to lie, to protect David Miscavige. And specifically, it was about the allegations of having been assaulted by Miscavige. Mike Rinder was at some event, it might have been a grand opening for a building, a Scientology building in London. I believe it was John Sweeney at that time, a BBC journalist who stuck a camera and a microphone in Mike's face. Is it true? David Miscavige assaulted? Is it true? And Mike denied it on camera and then turned around and to himself is like is what my life has been reduced to lying, to protect David Miscovich. This used to be about L Ron Hubbard. This used to be about Scientology. Now it's about protecting this douche bag MS Savage had just issued orders that was going to send Mike off to Australia. Mus like Miscavige is sadistic. That is, that is without question, sadistic meaning he enjoys inflicting pain upon others. So he very specifically was going to tell Mike, tell render or tell that cock sucker. We're shipping him off to Australia. He's never going to see his wife and his kids again essentially. And that's when Mike was like were the only reason I hadn't already left. if I follow the orders, gonna lose them. I leave Scientology, I'm gonna lose him. least if relief Scientology, be free of something. fucking sad."
