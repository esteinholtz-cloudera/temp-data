  "Text": "the way Lron Harbor and Scientology defines survival is very much intertwined with how they define ethics. Ethics. Anything, you know, to be ethical is pro survival, to be unethical is counter survival. But we were talking about just the concept of the dynamics, like what does survival refer to and it actually does refer to all of them, but just keep in mind when it comes to the seventh dynamic, Satan's collectively involved in here is the idea that a the cannot die. There's no such thing as killing a thing, a thing can only can only survive. And so, um anyway, uh this concept of the dynamics is one of the most fundamental and important concepts in scientology. But, but because I mentioned that it also gets tied up with ethics and this probably speaks to what you're just talking about is you can have the ideas and the concepts and you can have how do they go wrong they hold scientology, applying scientology, getting people into scientology is the key to basically saving every spiritual being in existence. you're analyzing what is ethical, it becomes whatever is good for scientology by definition ethical. Because anything that's good for scientology, which is a third dynamic is inherently good for all the dynamics. So that's where you get ends, justifying the means to do any anything possible and use any means necessary to for the aims of Scientology."
