  "Text": ", because also part of the Scientology, remember it works 100% of the time when used 100% correctly. And if it doesn't, could be because something's not being done, right? But it also could be because you're, you're doing bad things that you're not telling people about. Like if you're committing present time over its crimes, sins. would be like, that's part of the reason auditing isn't working on you is because you're committing criminal behavior that you're not being honest about. So every scientologist is sort of incentivized to, to make auditing work on them. Ok? Now, Alex, this work is a little crazy on OT three, you learn about the ot the body things for the first time. When you finish ot three, you attest to having achieved the state of having no more body things. And then you start ot four and he's like psych, got more, you got more BT S except those other BT S they had drug problems and that's why you couldn't find them the first time. So we're gonna do something a little different here, do something a little different. There gotta get rid of these BT S that were addicted to drugs. Ok. Then you finish OT four. And you're thinking, man, I hope we get to the good stuff soon and then you get to OT five and he's like psych, you got more BT S. You couldn't find these BT S because they were all bunched up together in clusters. And first you have to break up the clusters and then you can get rid of the BT S and you're like, OK, gotta do that."
