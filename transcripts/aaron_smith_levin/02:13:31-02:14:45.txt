  "Text": "you know, it's like, you know, it's still simmering there right under the surface, like pretty damn close to the surface. Do you know what I mean? And um sometimes ask about recovery and whatnot and like, what does that look like? And what does that mean? And it sort of goes back to kind of the emotional detachment as I go, what the fuck does recovery even mean if you're an alcoholic and you're recovering. You know what that means? I used to drink. I don't drink now. Well, I used to be in occult and I'm not in occult now. How else am I supposed to feel about this? For someone to be? Like, it seems like you've recovered. What the fuck does that even mean?, I'm sure some academic has an answer to that question. I'm not someone who I don't spend any time thinking about that. My recovery is success and a little bit of trolling and revenge, but mostly success. You know, what does it mean to be a recovered former cult member? What you don't cry when people ask you about your brother? I don't know what it means. I've never had therapy but not because I'm still like against it from Scientology. I just like, not going to pay to talk to someone. Do you know where else I could do that? Scientology? I know there's a lot of people going like, oh boy, I know there's a lot, I'm not shitting on therapy. would rather have a beer with my friend and talk about this shit than talk to a professional for $200 an hour. That's"
