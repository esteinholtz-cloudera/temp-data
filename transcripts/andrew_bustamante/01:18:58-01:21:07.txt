  "Text": "three levels of disguise by and large level one is what we also know what we also call light disguise. So that's essentially you put on sunglasses and a ball cap and, and that's a disguise, you look different than you normally look. So it's just different enough that someone who's never seen you before, someone who literally has to see you just from a picture on the internet, may not recognize you. That's why you see celebrities walk around with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats because they just need to not look like they look in the tabloid or not look like they look in TV. That's level one. Let me jump from level one to level three. Level three is all of your prosthetics. All the stuff you see in mission impossible, your fake ears, your fake faces, your fat suits, your stilts inside your leg, your feet. Uh All that's level three. Whenever they make any kind of prosthetic disguise, that's a level three disguise because prosthetics are very damning. If you are caught with a prosthetic, if you're caught a sudden wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses, nobody's gonna say you're a spy. But when you're caught with a custom made, you know, nose uh prosthetic that changes the way your face looks or when someone pops out a fake jaw and they see that your top teeth don't look like they did uh in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden you've got some very difficult questions to ask or to answer. level three is extremely dangerous. Level one is not dangerous. Level two is long term disguise. Level two is all the things that you can do to permanently change the way you look for a long period of time. So that whether you're aggressed in the street or whether someone breaks into your hotel room or whatever, it's real. So maybe that's uh maybe you get a tattoo, maybe you cut your hair short, maybe you grow your hair long maybe you go bald, maybe you start wearing glasses. Well, glasses are technically a prosthetic. But uh uh you can,, if you have teeth pulled, if you gain \u00a320 really gain \u00a320 or lose \u00a315 whatever you might do, all of that is considered level two. It's designed for a long term mission so that believe you are, who you say you are in that disguise. A lot of that"
