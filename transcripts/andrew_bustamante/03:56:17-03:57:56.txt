  "Text": "covert training base in Alabama in the south and far south and like the armpit of America where elite tier one operators go to learn human intelligence stuff there's a bar inside this base and on the wall is just a, it's scribbles of uh opinions and the, the question in the middle of the wall says, what's the meaning of life and all these elite operators over the last 25 or 30 years, they all go, they get drunk and they scribble their answer and they circle it with a sharpie, right? Love family America, freedom, right? Whatever. then they're the only thing they have to do is if they're going to write something on there, they have to connect it with something else on the wall, at least one other thing. So if they write love, they can't just leave it floating there. They have to write love in a little bubble and connect it to something else. Connected to family, whatever else. When you look at that wall, word self-respect is on the wall it's got a circle around it and then you can't see any other word because of all the things that connect to self respect. dozens of people have written over have written their words down and been and been drawn and scribbled over because of all the lines that connect self-respect. So what's the meaning of life from my point of view? I've never seen a better answer. all self respect. If you don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else? How can you love someone else if you don't have self-respect? How can you build a business you're proud of if you don't have self-respect, how can you raise kids? How can you make a difference? How can you pioneer anything? How can you just wake up and have a good day if you don't have self-respect"
