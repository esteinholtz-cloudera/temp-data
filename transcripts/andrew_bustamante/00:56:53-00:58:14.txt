  "Text": "are beautiful and that's what you're talking about. People are just, are beautiful creatures, culture and art and, and science like these are beautiful, beautiful things that come about because of human beings. And the thing that gives me hope is that matter what conflict the world has seen and we've seen some devastating, horrible crimes against humanity already. We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan. We saw, we saw genocide happen in Rwanda. We've seen horrible things happen people persevere language, culture, arts, science, they all persevere, they all shine through. Some of the most. People don't even realize how gorgeous the architecture and the culture is inside Iran. People have no idea. people in the rural parts of China are some of the kindest most amazing people you'll ever meet. And Korean arts and Korean dance. Korean drumming. I know nobody has ever even heard of Korean drumming. Korean drumming is this magical, beautiful thing. And the North in North Korea does it better than anybody in the world. Taekwondo. And North Korea is just exceptional to North Korea. knows this."
