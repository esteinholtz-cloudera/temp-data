  "Text": "you're laying out isn't incorrect and the miscalculations are not unexpected. Anybody who's been to a military college and including the army war College in Pennsylvania where so many of our military leaders uh are brought up. When you look at the conflict in Ukraine, it fits the exact mold of what ineffective, term military conflict, protracted military conflict would and should look like for military dominance. Now did Zelinsky and did the, did the Ukrainians shock the world? Absolutely. But in that, they also shocked American intelligence which like you said, miscalculated the whole world miscalculated how the Ukrainians would respond. Putin did not move in there accidentally. He had an assessment, he had high likelihood of a certain outcome that outcome did not happen. Why did he have that calculation? Because in 2014 it worked, invaded uh he took Crimea in, in 14 days, he basically created uh a uh an infiltration campaign that turned key leaders over in the first few days of the conflict. So essentially there was no conflict. It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia. Nobody talks about that. He invaded Georgia, the exact same same way and it worked. So in 2008, it worked. In 2014, it worked. There was no reason to believe it wasn't going to work again. he just carried out the same campaign. But this time, something was different. That was a miscalculation for sure on the part of Putin. And the reason that there was no support from the West because let's not forget there is no support. There is nothing other than the Lend Lease Act, is putting Ukraine in massive debt right now to the West. That's the only form of support they're getting from NATO or the United States. if somebody believed Ukraine would win, if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance, they would have gotten more material support than just debt and we can jump into that any time you want to. But the whole world miscalculated. Everybody thought Russia was going to win in 14 days. I I said that they would win in 14 days because that was the predominant calculation. the first invasion didn't work, then the military does what professional militaries do, man. They, they re evaluate, they re reorganize leaders and then they take, they take a new approach. You saw three approaches. The first two did not work. The first two campaigns against Ukraine did not work the way they were supposed to work. The third has worked exactly like it's supposed to work. don't need Kiev to win Ukraine you don't need hearts and minds to win Ukraine. What you need, what you need is control of natural resources which they're taking in the east and you need access to the heart beat, the blood flow of food and money into the country which they're taking in the South. The fact that Ukraine had to go to the negotiation table with Russia and Turkey order to get exports out of the Black Sea approved again. Demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing. the aggressor had a seat at the negotiation table to allow Ukraine the ability to even export one of its top exports. If Russia would have said no, then they would not have had that Russia has, that's like someone holding your throat. It's like somebody holding your jugular vein and saying if, if you don't do what I tell you to do, then I'm not gonna let you breathe. I'm not gonna let blood flow to your brain."
