  "Text": "weren't seen as heroes in the Vietnam War,? You gotta remember that when you, first of all, public service is a sacrifice. We oftentimes forget that we start to think, oh, government jobs are cushy and they're easy and it must be so easy to be the president because then you're basically a celebrity overnight. service is a sacrifice. It's a grind it for all of the soldiers. Do. The soldiers, the, the submariners, the missiles, the police officers, intelligence specialists, they all know what it's like to give things up to serve a public that can turn its opinion at any given time. history is what defines it. The more important thing is to understand that if you want a true open and fair democracy. You cannot control a narrative and starting to share all of your victories or starting to share your biggest victories with the intent of shaping public opinion to be supportive of the police force or supportive of CIA or supportive of you name it shaping a narrative that is intentional, operate operational use of influence to drive public opinion. That is something nobody wants to get into. It is much more professional to be a silent Sentinel, a silent servant humbly carrying the burden of public service in the United States where we are a fair and open democracy. Why,"
