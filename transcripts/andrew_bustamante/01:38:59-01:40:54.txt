  "Text": "I was leaving the Air Force, that was on my mind. I don't know what you were like at 27 but I was a total dip shit at 27. I'm not much better now at 42. But you and me both. I make it. But I was like, I just wanted to be anything other than a military officer. So I was actually in the process of applying to the Peace Corps through this thing called the internet, which was still fairly rudimentary. In 2007, I had a computer lab that we went to and it had 10 computers in it. You had to log in and log out and slow internet and everything else. But anyways, I was filling out an online application go work in the US Peace Corps. I wanted to grow my hair out. I wanted to stop wearing shoes that were shiny. I wanted to meet a hippie chick and have hippie babies in the wild, teaching Nigerian Children how to read. So that was the path I was going down. And as I filled in all of my details, there came this page that popped up and it was this blinking red page and it said stop here. You may qualify for other government positions you're willing to put your application on hold for 72 hours, that gives us a chance to reach out to you. So again, 27 year old dip shit, I was like, sure I'll put myself on hold if I might qualify for other government opportunities. And then about a day later I got a phone call from an un, an almost unlisted number. It just said 703. which was very strange to see on my flip phone at the time. Just 1703 area code. Uh, and I picked it up and, and it was, it was a person northern Virginia asking me if I would be telling me that I was qualified for a position in national security. And if I would be interested, they'll pay for my ticket and fly me up to, to Langley, Virginia. They didn't say CIA, they said Langley, I put one on one together and I was like, maybe this is"
