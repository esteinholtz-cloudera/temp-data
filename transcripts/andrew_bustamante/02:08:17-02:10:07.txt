  "Text": "? Yeah. So what I've seen as the norm, well, what I've seen is the cutting edge for corporations and the ultra we and the ultra wealthy and even uh intelligence organizations is that we have trip wires. It's better if you can't prevent from being hacked. The next best thing is to know as soon as you get hacked because then you can essentially terminate all the information you know it fast enough, you can just destroy the information. This is what the ultra wealthy do. They have multiple phones. So as soon as one phone gets hacked, the tripwire goes off, the operating system is totally deleted along with all data on the phone.

And then even in your intelligence and military worlds where the cyber where cyber warfare is active, the people who are aggressing are not trying to create aggression that beats security. They're trying to find a aggressive techniques, offensive techniques that have no security built around them yet it's too cost and time intensive to protect against what you know is coming. It's so much more efficient and cost effective to go after new vectors. So it just becomes like it, it becomes the most a silly game of, of your neighbor gets a guard dog you get a bigger guard dog and then your neighbor gets a fence. So you're just constantly outdoing each other. It's called the, the security paradigm people just they just one up each other because it's never worth it to just get to the same level. You're always trying to"
