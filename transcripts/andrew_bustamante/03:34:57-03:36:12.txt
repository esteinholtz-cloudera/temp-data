  "Text": "to take it one step further because I love this stuff. Personally, I love pink. I love pink matter stuff your interview with Jack Barsky. Jack's good. A good friend of mine, a good dude, incredible person. Yeah. In your conversation with Jack Barsky, you guys, he started talking to you about how his recruiters were feeding back to him, his own beliefs, his own opinions about himself, how smart he was, how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was. That's all pink matter manipulation, right back to the person. What they already think of themselves is a way to get them to invest and trust you faster because obviously you value them for all the right reasons because that's how they see themselves. So that, that loop that the K GB was using with Jack. Jack did not wake up to that loop at the time. He woke up to it later. it's, it's happens to all of us. We're all in a loop. It's just whether it's about oat milk or whether it's about aliens or whether it's about, you know, the democrats trying to take your guns, whatever it is, everybody's in a loop And we've got to wake up to, to ask ourselves just like you said, is it true or do we just really want it to be true? And until you ask yourself that question, you're just one of the masses trapped in the loop."
