  "Text": "in some way, shape or form with the character of Epstein. It's 100% guaranteed that some intelligence organization was involved. But let's, let's talk about why, let's talk about why. Ok, there's multiple types of intelligence assets, like we were talking earlier, there's foreign intelligence reporting assets, access agents and then there's agents of influence. Three different categories of, of intelligence, right? One is uh when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters, these are people who have access to secrets and their job is to give you their secrets in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution or whatever else, right? Their job is to give you secrets and then you pay them for the secrets. agents, their job is to give you physical access or digital access to something of interest to you. So maybe they're the ones that open a door that should have been locked and let you come in and stick your thumb drive in the computer. Or maybe they're the ones that, that share a phone number with somebody and then they're just like, just don't tell them you got the phone number for me. Their job is to give you access. you have these agents of influence. An agent of influences job is to be part of your effort to influence the outcomes in some way that benefits your intelligence requirements, right? Of these three types of people, the least scrupulous and the most shady is your agent of influence because your agent of influence understands exactly what they're doing. They know they're working with one guy they know they're giving, they're using the influence to, to manipulate some other guy it comes to powerful people, especially wealthy, powerful people. only thing that interests them is power. Money is not a challenge anymore. Prestige notoriety. None of those things are a challenge. The rest of us, we're busy trying to make money. We're busy trying to build a reputation. We're, we're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat at the highest levels. They're bored, they don't need any of that. The only thing that they care about is being able to wield power. So a character like Jeffrey Epstein exactly the kind of character that the Chinese would want, the Russians would want Mossad would want the French would want, it's, it's too easy because the man had access to a wide range of American influential people for corporate espionage uses for, for economic espionage uses for national security espionage uses. It doesn't make any sense that a person like that wouldn't be targeted. It doesn't. the question is"
