  "Text": "think financial. Yeah, absolutely. It's possible to infiltrate CIA. There's a long history of, Foreign Intelligence Services infiltrating CIA from Aldrick Ames to uh Jerry Lee recently with China. So we know CIA can be infiltrated. Uh even if they are infiltrated and even if that's interlocutor executes on their own agenda or their, the agenda as directed by their foreign adversary, their foreign handler that's different than organizational support for an event. I do think it's possible they could have been infiltrated at the time, especially it was a massive a ma a major priority for the Cubans and the Russians to infiltrate some aspect of, of uh us intelligence, multiple uh moles were caught in the years following. it's, it's not surprising that there would be a priority for that. But to say that the organization of CIA was somehow in cahoots with to independently assassinate their own executive. That's a significant stretch. I've seen no evidence to support that. And it goes contrary to everything I learned from my time at CIA."
