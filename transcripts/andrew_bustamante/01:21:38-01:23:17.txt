When you go undercover, what you claim to be, who you claim to be, that's called your legend, your cover legend. Every disguise would theoretically have own cover legend, even if it's just to describe why you're wearing what you're wearing, it's all a cover. So the method acting, this is a a fantastic point that I don't get to make very often. So I'm glad you asked the difference between CIA officers in the field and method actors is that method actors try to become the character. They try to shed all vestiges of who they really are and become the character. And that's part of what makes them so amazing. But it's also part of what like them mentally unstable over long periods of time. It's part of what feeds their depression, their anxiety, their personal issues because they, they lose sight of who they really are. Field officers don't get that luxury. We have to always, always remember we are a covert CIA intelligence officer collecting secrets in the field. We have to remember that. So we're taught a very specific skill to compartmentalize our true self, but make that true self true identity. So then we can still live and act and and uh effectively carry out our cover legend without ever losing sight without ever losing that compass true north of who we actually are. And then we can compartmentalize and secure all the information that we need, retain it, remember it, but then return to our true self we, when we get back to a position of safety, is"
