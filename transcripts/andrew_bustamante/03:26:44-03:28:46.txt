  "Text": "to push back on that idea, if we were to think about us, humans trying to communicate with ants., we observe for a while, there'll be a bunch of phd S written, a bunch of people just sort of collecting data, taking notes trying to understand about this thing that you detected. That seems to be a living thing, which is a very difficult thing to define from an alien perspective. Or from our perspective, we find life on Mars or something like that. OK. So you observe for a while, but then if you want to actually interact with it, how would you interact with the ants? I were to interact with the ants, I would try to infiltrate. would try to put like figure out what is the language they use to communicate with each other. I would try to operate at their physical scale like in terms of the physics of their interaction in terms of the information methods, mediums of information exchange with pheromones or whatever, however, the heck ants. So I would try to mimic them in some way. So in that sense, it makes sense that the objects we would see you mentioned by Peal. Yes, of course. It's ridiculous that aliens would actually be very similar to us. But maybe they create forms in order to be like, the the the humans will understand it and this needs to be sufficiently different from humans to know that there's something weird. I don't know. I, I think it's actually an incredibly difficult problem of figuring out how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you. people assume like if you're smart, it's easier to talk to the dumb thing. But I think it's actually extremely difficult when the gap in intelligence is just orders of magnitude. And so of course, you can observe, but once you notice the thing is sufficiently interesting, do you communicate with that thing?"
