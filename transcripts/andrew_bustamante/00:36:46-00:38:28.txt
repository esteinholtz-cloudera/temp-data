That's one thing and the other, there's some aspect of this war that I've just noticed that one of the people I talked to said that all great nations a independence war, have to have a war for their independence in order. There's something it's dark, but there's something about war just being a catalyst for finding your own identity. As a nation. So you can have leaders, you can have sort of signed documents, you can have all this kind of stuff. But there's something about war that really brings the country together and actually try to figure out what is at the core of the spirit of the people that defines this country. And they see this war that as the independence war to define the heart of what the country is. So there's, there's been before the war before this invasion, was a lot of factions in the country. There was a lot of influence from oligarchs and corruption and so on. A lot of that was the factions were brought together under one umbrella effectively to become one nation because of this invasion. So they see that as a positive direction for the defining of what a free country looks like after the war. At in their perspective, after the war is won,"
