  "Text": "me ask you about this because it comes up often. So I'm from MIT, and there's a guy by the name of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me to this day that some of the people I respect were interacted with this individual and fell into his,,, charm, charisma, whatever the, whatever the hell he used, uh, delude these people. He did so successfully. very open minded about this thing. I just, I would love to learn more, but a lot of people tell me. Um a lot of people, I respect that there's intelligence agencies behind this individual. So they were using Jeffrey Epstein for uh for getting access to powerful people and then to control and manipulate those powerful people. The CIA I believe is not brought up as often as Mossad. And so this goes back to the original aspect of our conversation is how much each individual intelligence agencies is willing to go to control, to manipulate, to achieve its means. Do you think there is? Can you educate me if um obviously you don't know, but you can bet, are the chances the intelligence agencies are involved with the character of Jeffrey"
