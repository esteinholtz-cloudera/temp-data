  "Text": "thing is extremely surprising about human nature. Um which is funny because that's not the answer I would have said. So I'm glad that you clarified this specific question. thing that's surprising about human nature is that human beings in their soul, there's like a painful longing to be with other people. that's really surprising because you, we all wanna pretend like we're strong, we all wanna pretend like we're, you know, independent, we all wanna pretend like we are the masters of our destiny. But what's truly consistent in all people is this like longing to commune with others like us? My, my more practical answer about what I've learned to be the truth is that people, human nature is predictable and that predictability is what gives people an incredible advantage over other people. But that's not the surprising piece. I mean, even when CIA taught me that human nature is predictable, it just made sense. I was like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. But what I never ever anticipated was matter where I've been in the world, no matter who I've talked to, no matter what socio-economic bracket is. That longing, man, it, it hurts, loneliness sucks and togetherness feels good. Even if you're together with someone, you know, isn't the right person. It still feels better than being alone. I mean,"
