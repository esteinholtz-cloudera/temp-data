  "Text": "time? The strategy that the United States has taken to support Ukraine is similar to the strategy we took to support Great Britain during world war two. the the enactment of the Lend Lease Act is a perfect example of that. The Lend Lease Act means that we are lending or leasing equipment to the Ukrainian government in exchange for future payment. every time a rocket is launched, every time a drone crashes into a tank, that's, that's a bill that Ukraine is, is just racking up. It's like when you go to a restaurant and you start drinking shots, sometime the bill will come due. This is exactly what we did when uh Europe and when Great Britain was in the face of a Nazi invasion, we signed the same thing in into motion. Do you know that that the UK did not pay off the debt from World War two until 2020? been paying that debt since the end of World War two. So what we're doing is we're indebted Ukraine against the promise that perhaps they will secure their freedom, which nobody seems to want to talk about what freedom is actually going to look like for Ukrainians. Right. What are the true handful of outcomes, the realistic outcomes that could come of this and what, which of those outcomes really looks like? Freedom to them, uh especially in the face of the fact that they're going to be trillions of dollars in debt to the West supplying them with the training and the weapons and the food and the med kits and everything else that we're giving them because no, none of it's free. It's all coming due. It's all. We're a democracy, but we're also a capitalist country. We, we can't afford to just give things away for free, we can give things away at a discount, we can give things away layaway, but the, the bill will come due. And unfortunately, that is not part of the conversation that's being had with the American people."
