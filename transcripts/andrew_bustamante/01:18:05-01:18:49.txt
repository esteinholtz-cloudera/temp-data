  "Text": "this so I discovered I had messy hair and CIA because I used to, uh I used to go mooj. We called it Mooj. I used to go Mujahideen style big burly beard and crazy wacky hair. Because an ambiguously brown guy with a big beard and long hair can go anywhere in the world without anyone noticing him. They either think that he's a janitor or they think that he's like some forgotten part of history, but nobody ever thinks that that guy is a spy. So it was the perfect for me. It was one of my favorite uh disguises. It's what's known as a level two disguise. One of my favorite disguises to dawn was just brown guy."
