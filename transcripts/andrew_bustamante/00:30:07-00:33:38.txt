  "Text": "don't need to win hearts and minds. That's a staunchly democratic point of view, hearts and minds mean, very little to people who understand core basic needs and uh and true power. You don't see Xi Jinping worrying about hearts and minds in China. You don't see you don't see it in North Korea. You don't see it in, in Congo, you don't see it in most of the world. Hearts and minds are a luxury. In reality. What people need is food, water power. They need income to be able to secure a lifestyle. It's, it is absolutely sad. I am not in any way, shape or form saying that my assessment on this is enriching or enlightening or or uh hopeful. It's just, it's just calculable empirical evidence. Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses, the influential losses, the economic losses, the lives lost, the power lost is too great. So it is better for him to push and push and push through war crimes through everything else. War crimes are something defined by the International Court system. The international Court system has Russia as part of its board and the international Court system is largely powerless when it comes to enforcing its own outcomes. So the real risk gain scenario here for, for Russia is is, is significantly in favor of gain over risk. other thing that I think is important to talk about is we, everybody is trapped in the middle of a gigantic information war. Yes, there's battlefield bullets and cannons and tanks, but there's also a massive inform informational war. The same that you see these ground troops in Ukraine, these Russian ground troops in Ukraine believing they're clearing the land of Nazis. information is being fed to them from their own home country. don't know why people seem to think that the information that they're reading in English is any more or less true. The every piece of news coming out of the West, every piece of information coming out in the English language is also a giant narrative being shared intentionally to try to undermine the the morale and the faithfulness of English speaking Russians, which somebody somewhere knows exactly how many of those there are. So we have to recognize that we're not getting true information from other side there is a strategic value in making sure that there is just the right amount of miss or disinformation out there. Not because someone's trying to lie to Americans, but because someone is trying to influence the way English speaking Russians think and in that world, that's exactly why you see so many news articles cited to anonymous sources, government officials who do not want to be named. There's no nothing that links back responsibility there, right? There's nothing that can go to court there. But this, the information still gets released and that's, that's enough to make Ukrainians believe that the United States is gonna help them or that the West is gonna help them. It's enough to make Russians think that, that they're going to lose and maybe they should just, and they should just give up now and leave from the battlefield. Now. We have to understand we are in the middle of a giant information war."
