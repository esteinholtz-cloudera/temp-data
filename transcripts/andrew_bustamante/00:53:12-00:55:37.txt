  "Text": ". You're right in the sense of the fact that it's I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team picked opposite sides on this. What I would say is that media discovered that talking about Ukraine as profitable as talking about something else. People simply the American people who read media or who watch media, they simply became bored reading about news that didn't seem to be changing much. And we've turned back into wanting to read about our own economy and we, wanted to hear more about Cryptocurrency and we wanted to hear more about the Kardashians. And that's, that's what we care about. So that's what the media writes about. That's how a capitalist market driven world works and that's how the United States works. That's why in both red papers and blue papers, red sources and blue sources. You don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much. If anything, would say that your Republicans are probably more in support of what's happening in Ukraine right now because we're creating new weapon systems. Our military is getting stronger. We're sending these military, we get to test military systems in combat in Ukraine. That's priceless in the world of the military. The military industrial complex being able to field test combat, test a, a weapon having to sacrifice your own people is incredibly valuable. You get all the data, you get all the performance metrics, but you don't have to put yourself at risk. That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops, the long term benefit to what will come of this for the United States. speaking in the lens of national security through military readiness, through uh future economic benefits. Those are super strong. The geopolitical fight is is essentially moot because Ukraine is not a geopolitical player, it was not for, for 70 years after this conflict is over, it will not again just think about what you were just saying with the American people's attention span to Twitter and whatever is currently going on. If the Ukraine conflict resolved itself today either in any direction. many weeks do you think before no one talked about Ukraine anymore? Do you think we would make it two weeks or do you think we'd make it maybe seven days? It would be headline news for one or two days then we'd be on to something else. It's just an unfortunate reality of how the world works in a capitalist democracy."
