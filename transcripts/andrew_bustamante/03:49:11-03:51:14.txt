  "Text": "they stop being consistent criminals? I, I've, I've, I, I never hesitate to admit this but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it. So now I hesitate because of the guidance. I've gotten to hesitate. Right. I like criminals. I'm friends with a number of criminals because the only people who get me like right away who get me are criminals because we know what it's like to basically abandon all the rules, do our own thing our own way and watch the world just keep turning. Most people are so stuck in the, the trap of normal thought and behavior that when I tell them they just don't just go tell people your name is Bill. Most people are going to say that's not gonna work but a criminal will be like, oh yeah, I did that once. I just told everybody my name is Nancy and dude. And they still believe me, criminals just get it right. So, uh what happens with criminals is they go to the school of hard knocks, they go to, they learn criminal behavior on the job. go to school, we go to the best spy school in the world. We go to Langley's uh the farm, right? What's known as field tradecraft course FTC in a covert location for a covert period of time and covert, covert covert. So if anybody from CIA is watching, I'm not breaking any rules. It's all on Wikipedia, but it's not coming from me. But we do. That's how we do it. They train us from 100 years of experience and the best ways to carry out covert operations which are all just criminal activities overseas. learn how to do it the right way so that we don't get caught, we learn how to be consistent. More importantly, we learn how to create an operation that has a limited lifespan because the longer it lives, the more at risk you are. So you want operations to be short, concise on the X, off the X limit your room for mistakes. Criminals want lo they default to wanting these long term operations because they don't want to have to recreate a new way to make money every 15 days."
