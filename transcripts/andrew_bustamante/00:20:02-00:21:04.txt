  "Text": "rare that I'll talk about just thinking, it's, I prefer to share my assessment, why I assess things a certain way rather than just what's my random opinion in my assessment? Vladimir Putin is winning. is winning. They're winning in Ukraine, but they're also winning the battle of influence against the West. They're winning in the face of economic sanctions, they're winning empirically, when you look at the math, they're winning. So when you ask me whether or not Putin is getting good information from his intelligence services. When I look at my overall assessment of multiple data points, he must be getting good information. Do I know how or why? I do not? don't know how or why it works there. I don't know how such deep cronyism, such deep corruption possibly yield true real results. And yet somehow there are real results happening. So it's either excessive waste and an accidental win or there really is a system in a process there that's functioning."
