  "Text": "are not alone. You think we're not alone? There's, it's an improbability that we are alone. If by virtue of the fact that sentient human life exists, intelligent human life exists, all the probabilities that would have to be destroyed for that to be true. Simply speak over the Galaxies that exist that there's no possible way we're alone. a mathematical equation. It's a, it's a one or a zero, right? And for me, it has to exist. It, it's impossible otherwise, rationally, for me to think that we are truly the only intelligent life form in all of the universe. think that an alien life form is anything like us at all is equally as inconceivable. To think that they're carbon based bipedal humanoid, uh alien species that just happen to fly around in metal machines and visit alien planets in a way that they become observed uh it's just silly. It's the world of sci fi, every good scientist because we always assume that they're superior to us in intelligence. When any scientist carries out an experiment, the whole objective of the experiment is to observe without disclosed or being discovered. So why on earth would we think that the superior species makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again?"
