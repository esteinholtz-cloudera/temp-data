I had a cat six C 12 which makes me nuclear cleared. My wife had other privy clearances that allowed her to look into, you know, areas that were, uh, specialized, but there was not, there wasn't a headline that went out that we couldn't fact check with a click of a few buttons she misses that because she loved that kind"
