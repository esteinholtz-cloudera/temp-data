  "Text": "is that the American experience after 911 is nothing like the American experience now. So all the terminology, all the, all this talk about privacy and privacy laws and mass surveillance and all this other stuff. It was a completely different time then. And that's not to say it was an excuse because to this day, I will still say mass collection bulk collection of data allows for an expedient identification of a threat to national security benefits, all of us. people don't understand what they want. Like people don't understand what the value of their own privacy is. First of all, the fact that people think they have personal privacy is laughable. have no privacy, the cell phone that you carry in your pocket you're giving permission to those apps constantly. You're giving commercial organizations what you and I have already said are less tied to ethical responsibility. You're giving them permission to collect enormous amounts of private data from you all the time. And do you know what happens if AT&T or Verizon sees some, some nefarious activity on your account? They do nothing. They might send a note to FBI because they have to according to some checklist. when NSA was collecting intelligence on metadata from around the United States, they were very specifically looking for terrorist threats that would harm American lives. don't man, NSA can clone my phone. I will give them my children's phone. I will give them the passwords to every one of my accounts if it means that there's a likelihood that my family will be safer from a nefarious actor who's intent on hurting us. doesn't care about your affair. NSA doesn't care if you're cheating on your taxes. NSA doesn't care if you're, if you talk shit about your boss or if you hate the US president, nobody cares about that. Your intelligence community is there to find threats to national security. That's what they're there to do. Snowden did when he outed that whole program. fact that the court, the justice system, the civilian justice system went back and essentially overruled the ruling of the intelligence courts before them just goes to show how the general mass community really shouldn't have a say in what happens in the intelligence community. They really shouldn't. You have politicians and you have the, you have the opportunity to elect people to a position then you trust them. That's what a representative republic is. You vote the people in, you trust them to work on your behalf. They make decisions without running them by you. They make decisions that, that, that they believe are in the best interest of their constituency. And that's how our form of democracy works. worked. We were safer now that we don't have that information. And now that there's this giant looming question of whether or not NSA is there to serve people or is collecting mass surveillance against all American people. That's not really a true accurate representation of what they were ever doing. They were looking for the needle in a haystack of the of the series of transactions in metadata that was going to lead to American deaths. We are now less secure because they can't do that. And that bothers me."
