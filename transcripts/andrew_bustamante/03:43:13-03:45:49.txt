  "Text": ". Uh I would say about a solid, 95% of what I learned at CIA carries over to the civilian world that 5% that doesn't is would carry over in a disaster, right? There's knowing how to shoot on target with my non dominant hand really only has one purpose. It's not gonna happen day to day, right? Knowing how to do a dead drop. That isn't discoverable by the local police force isn't going to be useful right now, but it could be useful in disaster. But the 95% of stuff that's useful. It's all tied to the human condition. It's all tied to uh being able to what someone's thinking. Understand what someone's feeling, direct, their thoughts, direct, their emotions, direct their thought process, win their attention, win their loyalty, win influence with them, grow your network, grow your own circle of influence. I mean, all of that is immensely, immensely valuable. as an example, the disguise, the disguise thing that we talked about earlier in and of itself has mixed utility. If you're Brad Pitt and you don't want anybody to know you're Brad Pitt, you put on a level one disguise and that's great. Or maybe you call me and I, I walk you through a level two disguise so that you can go to Aruba and nobody's gonna know you're in Aruba, right? Whatever it is. even there with the 5% that doesn't apply to everyday life, there's still elements that do. For example, when a person looks at a human being's face, the first place they look is the same part of the face as if they were reading a piece of paper. So in English, we start from the top left and we read left to right, top to bottom. So when an English speaking person interacts with another person, the first thing they look at isn't their eyes, the upper left from their point of view, corner of their, of their face, right? They look there and that's the the information they get is hair color, hair pattern skin color, right? That's it before they know anything else about the face. This is one of the reasons why somebody can look at you and then you ask them what color are my eyes? I don't really remember because the way they read the face, they read it from left to right top to bottom. they're paying a lot of attention to the first few things they see and then they're paying less attention as they go down the face. The same scrolling behavior that you see uh on the internet, right? So when you understand that through the lens of disguise, it allows you to make a very powerful disguise. The most important part of your disguise is here. If you're English speaking right here, if you're speaking some foreign languages that read right to left, right, if you're, if it's Chinese, you know that they're going to look from here down because they read left down.
