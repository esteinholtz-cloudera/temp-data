  "Text": "a difficult situation because trying to make sure that that you and all. Everybody listening understands that what's happening in Ukraine among Ukrainians is noble and brave and courageous and beyond the expectations of anyone. fact is there is no material support coming from the outside. The American in the American revolution was won because of French involvement. French ships. French troops, French generals, French military might. independence of of Communist China was won through Russian support. Russian generals, Russian troops on the ground fighting with the communists. That's how revolutions are won. That's how independent countries are born. Ukraine doesn't get any of that. No one is stepping into that because we live in a world right now there simply is no economic benefits to the parties in power to support Ukraine to that level. And war is a game of economics. economic benefit of Ukraine is crystal clear in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose. He will not let himself lose uh short of something completely unexpected, right? I'm talking 60% 70% probability Ukraine loses but there's still 20% 30% probability of the unimaginable happening. Who knows what that might be? An oligarch assassinates Putin or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere or who knows what? Right. still a chance that something unexpected will happen and, and change the tide of the war. But when it comes down to the core calculus here, Ukraine is the agricultural bed to support a future. Russia. knows they know they have to have Ukraine, they know that they have to have it to protect themselves against military pressure from the West. They have to have it for agricultural reasons. They have major uh oil and natural gas pipelines that flow through eastern Ukraine. They, they cannot let Ukraine fall outside of their sphere of influence. They cannot, the United States really have any economic vested interests in Ukraine ideologic, you know, ideological points of view. And promises aside, there's no economic benefit and the same thing goes for NATO. NATO has no economic investments in Ukraine. Ukrainian output. Ukrainian food goes to the Middle East and Africa, it doesn't go to Europe. the whole the the side, the West siding with Ukraine is exclusively ideological and it's putting them in a place where they fight a war with Russia. So the whole world can see Russia's capabilities. Ukraine is a, it's sad as it is to say, man, Ukraine is a pawn on a table for superpowers to calculate each other's capacities. now. We've only talked about Russia and the United States. We haven't even talked about Iran, we haven't even talked about China, right? It is a pawn on a table. This is a chicken fight so that people get to watch and see what the other trainers are doing."
