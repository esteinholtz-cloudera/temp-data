  "Text": ". So I want to draw a pretty hard line between perspective and empathy because empathy frankly an overused term by people who don't really know what they're saying. Sometimes I think you know what you're saying, but the vast majority of people listen, I would ask you that, but that's fine. As soon as you say, empathy, they're gonna just be like, oh yeah, I know I've heard this 1000 times empathy is about feeling other people feel understanding you would just say it's about feelings, it's about understanding someone else's feelings, feeling. Uh It's not the same as sympathy where you feel their feelings. Empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings and recognizing that their feelings are valid perspective is more than just feelings. It's about, it's about the brain, it's about the pink matter on the left side and the right side of the brain., I care about feelings. Uh And this goes directly to your point about connection. Yes, I care about feelings, but I also care about objectives. What is your life? What is your aspirational goal? What was it like to grow up as you? What was it like to experience this? And how did this shape your opinion on that? And you know what what is it that you're going to do next? More than just feelings, actual tactical actions. And that's, that becomes extremely valuable in the operational world. Because if you can get into someone's head, left brain and right brain feelings and logic, you can start anticipating what actions they're gonna take next. You can direct the actions that they're going to take next because you're basically telling them the story that's in their own head. it comes to relationships and personal connection. We talked about it earlier. The thing that people the most is. They, they want someone else who understands them. They want to be with people. They don't want to be alone. more you practice perspective, empathy or no empathy, the more you just validate that a person is there. I am in this time and space with you in this moment, feelings aside. Right. is powerful, that is intimate. And when it, whether you're talking about lovers or whether you're talking about a business exchange or whether you're talking about collaborators in a crime, I'm here with you, Ride or die. Let's do it. Right. That's powerful."
