  "Text": ". That's the high likely, that's the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome is that Ukraine remains air quotes a sovereign nation. not going to be truly sovereign it will become, it will uh have to have new government put in place. Zelinsky will, it's extremely unlikely he will be president because he has gone too far to demonstrate his power over the people and his ability to separate the Ukrainian people from the uh autocratic power of Russia. he would have to be uh unseated whether he goes into exile or whether he is peacefully left alone is all going to be part of the negotiations. But the thing, the thing to keep in mind also that a negotiated peace really just means a negotiated cease fire. We've seen this happen all over the world, North Korea and South Korea are technically still just a negotiated cease power. you end up having is Russia will allow Ukraine to call itself Ukraine to operate independently to have their own debt to the United States. Russia doesn't want to take on that debt. Uh And then in exchange for that, they will have firmer guidelines as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine. And then that becomes an example for all the other former Soviet satellite states, which are all required economically by Russia, not required economically by the West. then you end up seeing how it just, you can see how the whole thing plays out. Once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine,"
