  "Text": "for two reasons. It has to be secret. First. The, the mythos, the same thing we were talking about with, with General Petraeus, you can't brag about your victories. you want to let the myth shape itself, you can't do that. The second thing is, it's once something is uh once a victory is claimed, danger comes from letting your enemy know that you claimed the victory because they can reverse engineer and they can start to change how they did things. If a terrorist act. If a terrorist cell tries to execute an operation, the operation fails from their point of view, they don't know why it failed, they just know that it failed. But then if the US or if the American government comes in and says we took apart this, this amazing attack. Now they have more information,? The whole power of secrets like we talked about before the power of secrets is in knowing that not everybody has them. There's only a shelf life. take advantage of the shelf, the shelf life, you get space so you gotta keep it a secret. There is no tactical advantage from sharing a secret unless you specifically trying to achieve a certain tactical advantage from sharing that secret, which is what we've seen so much of with us. Intel, sharing with Ukraine, there's a tactical advantage from sharing a secret about Russian military movements or weaknesses in tanks or, you know, supply chain challenges, whatever it might be."
