  "Text": "go to answer for this has not really changed much over the last few years. So the, the first, the most important spy trick to change everything immediately something called perception versus perspective. all look at the world through our own perception. My dad used to tell me, my stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality. And I, I was, I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old, I told you so dad, you're still wrong. But perception is your interpretation of the world around you. But it's unique only to you. no advantage in your perception. That's why so many people find themselves arguing all the time trying to convince other people of their own perception. way that you win any argument, the way that you get ahead in your career, the way that you out sell or out outrace anybody is when you move off of perception and move into perspective, perspective is the act or the art of observing the world from outside of yourself. that's outside of yourself as like an entity just observing in a third from a different point of view or even more powerful. You sit in the shoes, you sit in the seat of the person opposite you and you think to yourself, what is their life like? What do they feel right now? Uh You know, are they comfortable? Are they uncomfortable? Are they afraid? Are they scared? What are they? What's the stressor that they woke up to this morning? What's the stressor that they're going to go to sleep with tonight? When you shift places and get out of your own perception into someone else's perspective, now you're thinking like them, which is giving you an informational advantage, but you know what they're all doing, everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception, not thinking about a different perspective. So immediately you have superior information, superior positioning, you have an advantage that they don't have. Uh and if you do that to your boss, gonna change your career. If you do that to your spouse, it's gonna change your marriage. If you do that to your kids, it's gonna change your family legacy because nobody else out there is doing it."
