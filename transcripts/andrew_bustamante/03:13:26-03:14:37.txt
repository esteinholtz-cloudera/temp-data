  "Text": ". Uh People are more incompetent of executing a conspiracy than they are of competently. Yeah, than they are of competently executing a conspiracy. really what it means is that it's so difficult to carry out a complex lie that most people don't have the competency to do it. So it doesn't make any sense to lead thinking of conspiracy. It makes more sense to lead assuming incompetence. When you look at all of the outcomes, all the findings from 911, it speaks to incompetence, it speaks brashly and openly to incompetence and nobody likes talking about it. FBI and CIA to this day hate hearing about it. 911 commission is going to go down in history as this painful example of the incompetence of the American intelligence intelligence community and it's going to come back again and again, every time there's an intel flap it's going to come back again and again., what are you seeing? Even right now? We miss, we miss the US intelligence infrastructure misjudged Afghanistan misjudged Hong Kong, misjudged Ukraine's in, uh, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Those were three massive misjudgments in a few years."
