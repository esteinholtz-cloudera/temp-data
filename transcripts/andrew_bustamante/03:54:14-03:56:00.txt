  "Text": "still time. So for all the young people out there deciding what to do,, I would just say the same thing that I would say that I do say and I will say to my own kids you only have one life, you only have one chance if you spend it doing what other people expect you to do. will wake up to your regret. At some point, woke up when I was 38 years old. My wife in many ways is still waking up to it as she watches her grandparents pass and uh and an older generation pass away. folks that I've that really have a blessed life are the people who learn early on to live with their own rules live their own way live every day as if it's the last day, necessarily to waste it by being wasteful or silly, but to recognize that today is a day to be productive and constructive for yourself. If you don't want a career, today is not the day to start pursuing a career just because someone else told you to do it. If you wanna learn a language, today is a day to find a way to buy a ticket to another country and learn through immersion. If you want a date, if you wanna get married, if you want business today is the day to just go out and take one step in that direction. And as long as you every day, you just make one new step, just like CIA recruited me. Just do the next thing. If the fir if the step seems like it's too big, then there's probably two other steps that you can do before that just make constant progress, build momentum, move forward and live on your own terms. That way you don't ever wake up to the regret"
