  "Text": "they've already got an advantage in the war. The fact that the war is still going on demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage, the fact that Russia has stepped up to the negotiating table with them several times just turning to Chechen Che. I mean, you remember what happened in Chechnya without turning to Chechnya levels, just mass blind destruction, which was another Putin War see that those things have happened. Demonstrates the asymmetric advantage that the West is given. I think the, the true way to look at the benefit of Ukraine as a uh a shining example of freedom in Europe for the West isn't to understand whether or not they could, they absolutely could. It's the question of how valuable is that in Europe? How valuable is Ukraine, which before January, before February, even thought about Ukraine and the people who did know about Ukraine knew that it was an extremely corrupt, former Soviet state 20% of its national population self identifying as Russian like you. There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine. There's a reason he's been promising he would go into Ukraine for the better part of a decade. Because the the circumstances were aligned, it was a corrupt country that's self identified as Russian in many ways. It was, uh it was supposed to be an easier of multiple marks in terms of the former Soviet satellite states to go after. all part of the miscalculation that the rest of the world saw too when we thought it would fall quickly. to think that it could be a shining, a shining example of freedom is accurate. But is it as shining a star as Germany? Is it as shining a star as the UK? Is it as shining a star as Romania? Is it as shiny a star as uh as France? Like it's got a lot of demo democratic freedom based countries in Europe to compete against to be the the shining stellar example. And in exchange on counterpoint to that, has an extreme amount of strategic value to Russia, which has no interest in making it a shining star of the example of, of democracy and freedom outside"
