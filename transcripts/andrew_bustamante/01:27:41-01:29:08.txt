  "Text": ". Well, it's interesting. So I would, I would say that um or maybe I'm wrong actually on that. I would say that once you understand the system, it's not that hard, it makes a lot of sense. But I would also say that to your to your exact point you are right that people smell bullshit. People smell bullshit. But here's the thing, if you come in smelling like goat shit, still smell like shit, but you don't smell like bullshit. So they don't count you out right away. And if you come in smelling like rotten tomatoes or if you come in smelling like lavender or if you come in smelling like Manilla or if you come in without any smell at all, all that matters is that you don't smell like bullshit. Here's the thing that's, that's one of the secret sauces of CIA. you look and act like a spy. People think you're a spy. If you look and act in any other way, you know what? They never ever think you are spy. They might think you're an idiot. They might think you're a, they might think you're trailer trash. They might think that you're a uh a migrant worker, but they never think you're a spy. And that's what's that lesson in everyday life immensely powerful. If you're trying to, if you're trying to take your boss's job, as long as you don't ever look like the bo the employee who's trying to take the boss's job, the boss is focused on all the employees who are trying to take his job. Everybody's prioritizing whether they know it or not, the goal is to just not be the one that they're targeting, target them without them knowing you're targeting them."
