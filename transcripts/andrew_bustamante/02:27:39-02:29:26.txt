  "Text": "question of ethics is a great question. So let me, let me start this whole thing out by saying, CIA hires people a on a spectrum of our ability to be morally flexible, ethically flexible all people at their heart are ethically flexible. would never punch somebody in the face. Right. Some people out there would say I would never hurt another human being. But as soon as a human being posed a direct threat to their daughter or their son or their mother, now all of a sudden they're gonna change their ethical stance. Yeah. In self defense. Right. But at the end of the day it's still hurting another, her hurting another person. So what CIA looks for is people who are able to swing across that, that spectrum lesser offenses, right? More flexibility. do not believe that private intelligence and the laws of economics lend themselves to increased ethics or increased ethical behavior in the short term. what ends up happening is that in the long term, order to scale economic benefits, you are forced to act within norms of your customer base. So as the norms of that customer base dictate certain requirements, the company has to adapt to those requirements in order to continue to scale. So if, if a company tries to ostracize Q or if they try to ostracize men or ostracize women, they're limiting their ability to grow economically. They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing ethical requirement of their customer base."
