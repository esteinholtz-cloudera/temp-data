  "Text": "also just not using anybody else's services, doing the, doing everything myself.

It's several thousands of machines. And they asked, um can get your data back if you pay, I forget what it was, but it was um it was about a couple of $1000 QN A can get all the data back for their customers if they pay, I think $2 million. But that came from me relying on the systems of others for security. I was, I assumed this company would have their security handled. But then that was a very valuable lesson to me. I now have like layers of security and also an understanding which data is really important, which is somewhat important, which is not that important and layering that all together."
