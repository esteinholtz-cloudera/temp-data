  "Text": "standard classification for all human intelligence operations is something called 25 x 225 by two. So 50 years, 25 years, times two years or times two rounds. So essence, anything that I've seen has the first chance of becoming public domain declassified after 50 years, unless there's some congressional requirement for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier. So by then, you know, I'll be 80 something years old or, or potentially dead, which is either way when it's, it's it can come out. Uh according to its typical classification, the, the value of secrets I I have seen is that secrets create space, give opportunity for security. They give opportunity for thinking, they give space and space is an incredibly advantageous thing to have. If you know something, somebody else doesn't know, even if it's just 15 or 20 minutes different, you can direct, you can change the course of faith. So I, I find secrets to be extremely valuable, extremely useful. Uh even at the place where secrets are being kept from a large mass of what all Americans need to understand is that one of the one of the tradeoffs to building a system of government that allows us to be first world and wealthy and secure and successful. One of the tradeoffs is that we have given up a great deal of personal freedom and one of the personal freedoms that we give up is the freedom of knowing we wanna know. You get to know what the government tells you. You get to know what you need to know or what you've learned yourself. But you don't get to know secrets. who do get to know secrets, know them for a reason. That's why it's called a need to know"
