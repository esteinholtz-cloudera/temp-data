  "Text": "me ask you about uh so back to operation Northwoods because it's such a powerful of tool, sadly, powerful tool used by dictators throughout history, the false flag operation. So I think there's a and you said the, the terrorist attacks in 911, were changed a lot us? For, for, for the, for the United States, for Americans? It changed the way we see the world that woke us up to the harshness of the world. I think there is to my eyes. At least there's nothing that shows evidence that 911 was a quote inside job. the CIA or the intelligence agencies or the US government capable of something like that? But that's the question. So there's a bunch of shadiness about how it was reported on. I just can't, that's the thing I struggle with., while there's no evidence that there was an inside job, it raises the question to me. Well, something like this be an inside job? Because it's sure as heck now looking back 20 years, the amount of money that will spend on these wars, the military industrial complex, the, the amount of interest in terms of power and money involved, organizationally can, um can something like that"
