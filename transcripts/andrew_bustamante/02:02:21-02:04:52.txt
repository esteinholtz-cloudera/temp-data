  "Text": ", the moment you start to think about germs, right. Like you start to freak out and you become sort of paralyzed by the stress of it. So you have to balance those two things. You know,, if you think about all the things that could hurt you in this world and all the risk you can take is, um, can overwhelm your life that said the cyber world is a weird world because it's, uh, it doesn't have the same, you know, I know, I know not to cross the street without looking each way because there's a physical intuition about it. I, I, I'm not sure, you know, I'm a computer science guy so I have some intuition but it's cyber world. It's really hard to build up an intuition of what is safe and not, you know, I've seen a lot of people just logging out of your devices all the time, like, regularly, just like that physical access step is a lot of people don't take, I can just walk in into the offices of a lot of CEO S and it's like everything is wide open for, for physical access of those systems, which is kind of incredible for uh somebody that sounds really shady, but it's not, I've, I've written key loggers like things that record everything you type in the mo mood. like I, I did that for um during my phd, I was recording everything you do on, on your device and everything you do on your computer to like people sign up to the study, they willingly do this to understand behavior. I was trying to use machine learning to identify who you are based on different biometric and behavioral things, uh which allows me to study human behavior and to see which is uniquely identifiable. And the goal there was to remove the need for a password. the how easy it is to write a thing that logs everything you type. I was like, wait a minute, like I can probably get a lot of people in the world to run this for me. I can then get all of their passwords. I mean, you could do so much like I can run the entirety of the CIA for just myself if I was. And I imagine there's a lot of really good hackers like that out there. Much better than me. Um So I tried to prevent myself from being all the different low hanging fruit attack vectors in my life. I try to make it difficult be that. But then I'm also aware that there's probably people that are like five steps ahead."
