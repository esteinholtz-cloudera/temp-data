  "Text": ". Absolutely. And here's, there's a few reasons why. Right. So first M BT I makes the claim that your core personality doesn't change over time. And that's how it, that's how it's calibrated. And one of the big arguments is that people say that your personality can change over time., what I, in my experience, the M BT I is exactly correct. You can, your core personality does not change because your core personality is, is defined as your personality when all resources are removed. So essentially your emergency mode, your dire conditions, that is your core personality, we can all act a little more extroverted. We can all, you know, be a little more empathetic when we have tons of time and money and patience. you strip away all that time, money and patience. How empathetic are you? How, how much do you like being around other people? How much do you like being alone? Do you make judgments or do you, do you analyze information? Uh that's what's so powerful about M BT I is it, it's talking about what people are like when you strip away resources and then because it's so consistent it's also only four codes. It's super easy to be able to assess a human being through a dialogue, through a series of conversations, be able to hone in with high accuracy. What is their four code, four letter code? There's only 16 options and it becomes extremely valuable. Is it perfectly precise? And does everybody do it the same? I mean, those things are the answers to those are no, but is it operationally useful in a short period of time? That is a resoundingly powerful. Yes."
