  "Text": "? Absolutely. Yeah. And it's not as hard as you might think. It's not convenient. Again. Convenience and security. You can disappear tomorrow. Right. I can walk you through three steps right now. That's gonna help you disappear tomorrow. But none of them are convenient. They're all extremely secure.. The first thing you do is every piece of digital technology you have. That's, that is connected to you in any way is now dead. You just let the battery run out forever forever. You never touch it again. Starting at this moment, you have to do is go out and acquire a new one. Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one in the United States by buying it because to do so you would tie it to your credit card, you would tie it to a location, a time or place a registered name, whatever else. So you would have to require it essentially by theft or through the black market. So you would want something because you're gonna need the advantage of technology without it being in your name. you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop, you do whatever you have to do to make sure that you can get on with the password and whatever else that might be as, as dirty or as clean as you want that to be. We're all morally flexible here. now you have a technological device that you can work with. Uh and then from there on, you're just doing whatever you have to do, whether you're stealing every step of the way or whether you, uh you run a massive con. Keep in mind that we often talk about con men and con. Do you know what the root, the word that con is a root word for confidence? what a con man is. A con man is a confidence man. Just somebody who is so brazenly confident that the people around them living in their own perception, not perspective and their perception. They're like, well, this guy really knows what he's talking about. So I'm gonna do what he says. So you can run a massive con and that can take care of your finances that can take care of your lodging whatever amount, whatever else it is, you are whoever you present yourself to be. So if you wanna go be, if you wanna be Bill for the afternoon, go tell people your name is Bill. They're not going to question you."
