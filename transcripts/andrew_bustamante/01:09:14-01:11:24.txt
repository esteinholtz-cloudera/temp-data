  "Text": "that's what CIA does. Well, to go back to your first question, what the CIA do, they don't answer any questions, they don't say anything and wherever the myth goes, the myth goes, whether it's that they sold drugs or used child prostitutes or whatever else, wherever the myth goes, they let it go at the end of the day, everybody sits back and says, wow, I really just don't know. Now, the second thing that I learned from Petraeus and I, I really am a big fan of Petraeus. I know he made personal mistakes. You don't get to be that powerful without making personal mistakes. when I worked out with him, the one thing that, that my uh the one thing that my commanding officer told me not to ask about, he was like, never ask the general about his family. I'm a family guy. So as soon as I met General Petraeus. One of the first things I asked him was, hey, what was it like raising a family and being commander of forces in the Middle East, like you weren't with your family very much. And the thing I love about the guy, he didn't bite off my head. He didn't snap at me. He didn't do anything. He openly admitted that he regretted some of the decisions that he made because he had to sacrifice his family to get there, relationships with his Children. absentee father, missing birthdays, missing. We ju we all say, we all say how sad it is to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries, yada yada yada. Everybody knows what that feels like. Even business people know what that feels like. The actual pain that we're talking about is when you're not there to handle your 13 year old's questions when a boy breaks up with her or what you're when you're not there to handle the bloody lip that your nine year old comes back with from their first encounter with a bully. are the truly heartbreaking moments that a parent lives and dies by. He missed all of those because he was fighting a war that we forgot and we gave up on 20 years later, right? It's so honest about that. Um And it was really inspiring to me to be told not to ask that question. And when I broke that guidance, he didn't reprimand me he just, he was authentic and it was absolutely one of the big decisions that helped me leave CIA on my own in 2014."
