  "Text": "bunch of people who I'm trying to bring honor to whether I know them or respect them as irrelevance. These are people who are out there doing the the deed every day and I want to bring them honor and I wanna do that in a way that get to share what they can't share and what they won't share when they leave because they will also feel the silent pressure, the pressure to the shame, the judgment, right? Um But the truth is that I've, I've done this now long enough, the first few times that I spoke out publicly, the response to being a positive voice for what the sacrifice is that people are making. It's so refreshing to be of an honest voice that people don't normally hear that it's too important. One day, I'm gonna be gone and my kids are gonna look back on all this and they're gonna see their dad trying to do the right thing for the right reasons. even if my son or daughter ends up at CIA and even if they get ridiculed for being, oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right. Your dad's a total sellout, whatever it might be., I want them to know, you know, dad was doing what he could to bring honor to the organization, even when he couldn't stay in the organization anymore."
