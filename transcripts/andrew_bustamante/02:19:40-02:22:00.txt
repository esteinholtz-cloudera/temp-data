  "Text": ". It's, uh, it's something that so few people know about and it became a more mainstream topic with the Trump administration because Trump made it no secret he was going to hire private intelligence organizations to run his intelligence operations and fund them. So that really brought it to the mainstream. But going all the way back to 911, going all the way back to 2001. When, when the 911 attacks happened, there was a commission that was formed to determine the reasons that 911 happened. And among the lists that they determined, of course, they found out that the intelligence community wasn't coordinating well with each other. were Fife dos and there was infighting and there wasn't good intel sharing. But more than that they identified that we were operating uh at Cold War levels, even though we were living in a time when terrorism was the new biggest threat to national security. the big recommendation coming out of the 911 commission was that the intelligence organizations, the intelligence community significantly increased the presence of intelligence operators overseas. And in terms of analytical capacity here in the United States, they made that decision, it completely destroyed, it totally was incongruent with the existing hiring process because the existing hiring process for CIA or NSA is a 6 to 9 month process. The only way they could plus up their sizes fast enough was to bypass their own hiring and instead go direct to private organizations. naturally, the government contracted with the companies that they already had secure contracts with Boeing Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Khaki, you know, you name it. And then over time from 2001 to now or I guess that started really in 2004 when they started significantly increasing their private, the presence of private intelligence officers from there. From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing. It's become a, it's become a continuity of operations thing. And now the reason Northern Virginia has become one of the wealthiest codes in America is because of the incredible concentration of private intelligence that is supporting CIA NSA Dia FBI and all the slew of IC partners."
