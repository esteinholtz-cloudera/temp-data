  "Text": "? Think about? So let's just walk through that exact example, right? Because this is, it's a preponderance. It's a, it's a preponderance fear. It's a ridiculous fear because if you would have to tap on multiple elements of government for anything to happen. So for example, just say that somebody goes to the NSA and says, hey, can you give us a read out on all the people who are tweeting terrible things about the president? Ok, cool. Here's your 100 million people, whatever it is. Right. Here's all the people saying negative things about the government. now they have a list. What do they do next? Well, let's just make it simple. They stay with NSA and they say surveil them even more tap their phones, tap their computers. I wanna know even more so then they get this preponderance of evidence. What do you do with evidence? You take it to a court?, guess what? No court is going to support that goes against freedom of speech. the court is not going to support what the executive is asking them to do. Even before you take somebody to court, you have to involve law enforcement. Essentially, you have to send some sort of police force to go apprehend the individual who's in question. Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria for any police force anywhere in the United States, arresting people who have, have to say negative things about the president. Now, if somebody poses a threat to the life of a public figure or the threat to life of a politician, that's a completely different case, which means the standards of evidence are much higher for them to arrest that person. So unless you create a secret police force, your actual public police force is never going to take action. So all these people who are afraid of this, this exact situation that you're outlying, they need the creation of a secret police force, the creation of a secret court that operates outside the judicial system, the creation of a secret intelligence service that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection. Also that a handful of people who don't like the president what whisked away assassinated, put in prison. Who knows, what, about the resources that would be the amount of money and time and how hard would it be to keep that secret to have all of those things in motion? The reason it worked in, in Russia and Soviet Germany or Russia and communist Germany was because everybody knew there was a secret police. Everybody knew that like that there was a threat to work, to speaking out against the government. It's completely different here. Well,"
