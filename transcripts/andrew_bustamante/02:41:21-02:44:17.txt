  "Text": "that. that said if you did do the surveillance. So that's the support, the sort of the incentives aren't aligned. It seems like a lot of work to do for the thing you can do without the surveillance. But, you know, yes, the courts wouldn't if, if you were to be able to get a list of people which I think that part you could do that opposed the government. You could do that, like, just like you said on Twitter publicly, you could make a list with that, you can start to, especially if you have a lot of data on those people find ways in which they did violate the law, not because they oppose the government, but because in some other way, the parking tickets or didn't pay the taxes, that's probably a common one or like screwed up something about the taxes. I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine. very good at this kind of stuff knowing how the citizens screwed everything up because especially in those countries, everybody's breaking the law because in a corrupt nation, you have to bend the law to operate the world. The number of people that pay taxes fully in those nations is just very low, if not zero. And so they then use that breaking of the law to come up with an excuse to actually put you in jail based on that, know. So it's possible to imagine. But yes, I think, think that's the ugly part of surveillance, but I do think just like you said, the incentives aren't correct. Like you really don't need to get all of the secret police and all of these kinds of organizations working. If you do have a charismatic, powerful leader that built up a network that's able to control a lot of organizations to, to a level of authoritarianism a government. They're just able to do the usual thing. One have propaganda machine to tell narratives to pick out, you know, people that they can put in jail for opposing the state and maybe loud members of the press start silencing the press. There's a, there's a playbook to this thing and it doesn't require the surveillance, the surveillance, you know, what is useful for the surveillance is the thing you mentioned in China, which is everybody the citizenry to watch each other to say there's enemies of the state everywhere. And then you start having Children reporting on their parents and that kind of stuff. Again, don't need a surveillance date for that. Now, the good of a surveillance system, if it's operating within ethical bounds is that yes, it could protect the populace. So you're saying like the good given on your understanding of these institutions, good outweighs the bad."
