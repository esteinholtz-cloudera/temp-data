  "Text": "it's interesting. Uh First, I'm glad that JFK rejected it. That's uh a good sign. So we have to understand that good ideas are oftentimes born from bad ideas. Uh I had a really good friend of mine who actually went on to become a pastor he used to say all the time that he wanted all the bad ideas on the table. Like give me all your bad ideas every time we had any kind of conversation. And I, I was always one of those people who's like, isn't a bad idea, just a waste of time. he was like, no, because the best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas. So again, Cuban missile crisis, uh mass hysteria in the United States about nuclear war from Cuba missiles, blowing up American cities faster than we could even see them coming. It makes sense to me that a president would go to, especially the part of CIA, which is the, the special activities division. It makes perfect sense to me that the president would go to a division called special activities whose job it is to create, know, crazy ideas that have presidential uh approval, but nobody knows they exist. it makes sense that he would challenge a group like that to come up with any wacky idea, right? Come up with anything. Just let's start with something because we can't have, we can't bring nothing to the table. We have to do something about this Cuban issue. And then that's how an operation like that could reasonably be born. Not because anybody wants to do it, but because they were tasked by the president to come up with five ideas. And it was one of the ideas still happens to this day. They, the president will still come in, but it'll basically send out a notice to his covert action arm and he will say I need this and I need it on Wednesday and people have to come back with options for the thing. He asked for a finding, he will issue a presidential finding and then his covert action arms have to come back and say, here's how we would do this and hide the hands of the Americans."
