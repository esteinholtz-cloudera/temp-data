I think in the short term, you can benefit by sharing a secret. But in the long term, if people know they can trust you like the juicy of the secret, if it's a test of sorts,, if they know you can keep that secret, that means like you're somebody that could be trusted. And I believe that like not just effectiveness in this life but happiness in this life is, is in forming a circle of people you can trust, right?"
