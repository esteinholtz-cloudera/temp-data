  "Text": "in my experience at CIA? That is an area that remains very compartmented. that could be one of two reasons it could be because there is significant interest and that's why it's so heavily compartmented it could be because it's an area that's non, that's just not important. It's a, it's a distraction so they compartment it so it doesn't from other operations. Um One of the areas that I've been quite interested in and where I've done a lot of research and I've done some work in the private intelligence and private investigation side is with UFO S. place where UFO S really connect with the federal government is when it comes to aviation safety and predominance of power. So FAA and the US Air Force and the US military are very invested in knowing what's happening in the skies above the United States and that's of primary interest to them when they can rule out the direct threat to national security of UFO S, then they become less interested. said when you have unexplained aerial phenomenon that are unexplained that can't directly be tied to uh to anything that is known of the terrestrial world, they, they're left without an answer to their question. They don't know if it's a threat or not a threat. But I think the scarier concern for the US National government or for the US Federal government, the scarier concern that nobody talks about is what if the UFO isn't alien? What if it is actually a cutting edge machine that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate. Or"
