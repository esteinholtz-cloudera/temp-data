  "Text": "me sort of focus in on this relationship between the president or the leader and the intelligence agency and look outside the United States. seems like authoritarian regimes or regimes throughout history. If you look at Stalin and Hitler, if you look at today with Vladimir Putin, negative effects of power, corrupting the mind of a leader manifest itself is that they start to get bad information from the intelligence agencies. So this kind of thing that you're talking about over time, they start hearing information they want, they want to hear, the agency starts producing only the kind of information they want to hear. And the leader's worldview starts becoming distorted to where propaganda they generate is also the thing that the intelligence agencies provide to them. And so they start getting this, they start believing their own propaganda and they start getting a distorted view of the world, sorry for the sort of uh walking through in a weird way. But I guess I want to ask, do you think, let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically, do you think he's accurate information about the world? Do you think he knows the truth of the world? Whether that's the war in Ukraine, whether that's the behavior of the other nations in NATO, the United States in general? What do you think?"
