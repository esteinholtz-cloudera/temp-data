  "Text": "away. And one of them I was going to share with you anyway. So I'm glad that you asked the question. So the first is that, uh, on our runs and man, he runs fast and we would go for six mile runs through Bangkok. And, uh, and he talked openly about, I asked him, do you keep this, this my, this mystery, this epic mythology about your fitness and your strength. How do you keep all of this alive with the troops? And he had this amazing answer and he was like, I don't talk about it. are born not from somebody orchestrating the myth, but from the source of the myth simply being secretive. So he's like, I don't talk about, I've never talked about it. I've never exacerbated it. I just do what I do. And I let the troops talk and he's like, when it's in favor, when it goes in favor of, of discipline and loyalty and commitment, let it run. If it starts getting destructive or damaging, then I have my, my leadership team step in to fix it. But when it comes to the, the mythos, the myth of him being superpowered soldier, that's what he wants every soldier to be. So he lets it run and he was fanta, it was so enlightening when he told me when there's a myth that benefits you, you just let it go, you let it happen it gets you further without you doing any work, it costs no investment. So the catalyst"
