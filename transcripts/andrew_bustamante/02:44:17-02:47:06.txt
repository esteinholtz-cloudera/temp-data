  "Text": ". So let me give you just a, a practical example. So people don't realize this, but there's multiple surveillance states that are out there, there are surveillance states that are close allies with the United States. One of those surveillance states is, is uh the United Arab Emirates, the UAE. No, I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020. Uh came back on a repatriation flight after COVID broke out, but we were there for a full year. We were, we were residents. We had I DS. We had everything. Now when you get your national ID in the Emirates, you get a chip and that chip connects you to everything. It connects you to cameras, it connects you to your uh license plate on your card, to your passport, to your credit card. Everything everything is intertwined. Everything is interlinked. you drive, there are no police, there are no police on the roads. Every 50 to 100 m, you cross a camera that reads your license plate measures your speed. And if you're breaking the speed limit, it just immediately charges your credit card because it's tied, it's all tied together. Totally surveillance. That technology was invented by the Israelis who use it in Israel I was in Abu Dhabi and I was rear ended at high speed by what turned out to be an Emirati official, a senior ranking official of one of the Emirates. was caught on camera. His ID was registered, my ID was registered. Everything was tied back to our I DS. The proof and the evidence was crystal clear even still. He was emir rai. I was not. So when I went to the police station to file the complaints, it was something that nobody was comfortable with because generally speaking, Emiratis don't don't accept legal claims against their own from foreigners. But the difference was that I was an American and I was there on a contract supporting the Emirati government. So I had these different variances. Right. Long story short in the end, the surveillance states is what made sure that justice was played because the proof was, was incontrovertible. was so much evidence collected because of the surveillance nature of their state. Now, why do they have a surveillance state? It's not for people like me, it's because they're constantly afraid of extreme extremist, terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi or inside the UAE because they're under constant threat from Islam and they are from, from extremists and they're under constant threat from Iran. So that's what drives the people to want a police state to want a surveillance state for them. survival is paramount and they need the surveillance to have that survival for us. We haven't tasted that level of, of desperation and fear yet or hopefully never. But that's what makes us feel like there's something wrong with surveillance. is all about the purpose. It's all about the intent."
