  "Text": "think it's used, it's absolutely used. It's called sex. It's, that's the term that we jokingly call it a sex spion. But yeah, the, the art of attraction appeal. Um the manifestation of feelings through sexual manipulation, all of that is, is super powerful tool. Uh The Chinese use it extremely well. The Russians use it extremely well. Uh in the United States, we actively train our officers not to use it because in the end, it leads to complications and how you professionally run a case. So we train our officers not to use it. However, can't control what other people think. So, if you're an attractive male or an attractive female officer and you're ha you're trying to talk to a, you know, an older general who just happens to be gay or happens to be straight and is attracted to you. Of course, they're going to be that much more willing to talk to an American who is also attractive. So it's, it's hard to walk that back"
