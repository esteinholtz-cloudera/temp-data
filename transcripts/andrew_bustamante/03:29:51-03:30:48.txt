  "Text": "biological thing is in the queen. Right. But they're, they're not, it's not a fair equivalent. But let's look at gorillas or let's look at something in the monkey family. Right. Where we largely, we agree that there, there is some sort of intelligence there or dolphins, some sort of intelligence, right? is a human thing, a human thing to want to observe and then communicate and integrate. a human thing, not an intelligent life thing. for us to even think that a foreign and intelligent alien species would want to engage and communicate at all is an extremely human as assumption. And then from that assumption, then we started going into all the other things you said, if they wanted to communicate, wouldn't they want to mimic if they wanted to mimic, wouldn't they create devices like ours? So now we're three steps removed from the, the true fact of there's something unexplainable in the skies."
