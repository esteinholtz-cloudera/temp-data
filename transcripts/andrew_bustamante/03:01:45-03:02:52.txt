  "Text": "? You've got to look through the lens of time. You've got to look at where we were historically at that time there was the peak of the Cold War, our enemies were doing the same kind of experimentation. It was essentially of another space race. What if they broke through a new weapon technology faster than we did? What would that mean for the safety and security of, of uh the American people? So right decision or want wrong decision, was guided by and informed by national security priorities. So from this program that was designed to uh use drugs to drive interrogation and torture people was born something very productive operation, Stargate, was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics to try to collect intelligence. Now, even though in the end, the outcome of MK ultra and the outcome of Stargate were mixed, nobody really knows if they did or didn't do what they were supposed to do. We still know that to this day, there's still a demand in the US government and in CIA for people who have sensitivities to ethereal energies."
