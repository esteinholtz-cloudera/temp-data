  "Text": ", for me, the calculation is very clear. It's family. I left CIA I chose my family. And when my son was born, my, my wife and I found out that we were pregnant while we were still on mission. We were a tandem couple. My wife is also a former CIA officer undercover. Like me, we were operating together overseas. We got the positive pregnancy tests like so many people do. And uh and she cried, my wife was a bad ass. I was just, was like the accidental spy, but my wife was really good at what she does. And uh and she cried and she was like, what, do we do now? Like it's what we've always wanted a child, but we're in this thing right now and like there's no space for a child. long story short, um We had our baby, we CIA brought us back to have the baby and when we started having the conversations about, hey, what, what do we do next? Because we're not the type of people to want to just sit around and domestic. Uh What do we do next? But keep in mind we have a child now. So here's some of our suggestions, we could do this and we can do that. Let us get our child to a place where we can put him into an international school or we can get him into some sort of program where we have the, we can both operate together again during the day. But CIA just had no, they had no patience for that conversation. There was no family is not their priority. So the fact that we were a tandem couple, two officers, two operators trying to have a baby was irrelevant to them. So when they didn't play with us, when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood as part of our overall experience, that's when we knew that they never would. And what good is it to commit yourself to a career if the career is always going to challenge the thing that you value most? And that was the calculation that we made to leave CIA, not everybody makes that calculation. a big part of why I am so vocal about my time at CIA is because I am immensely appreciative of the men and women who to this day have failed marriages and poor relationships with their Children because they chose national security. They chose protecting America over their own family. Um And they've done it though it's made them ab you know, abuse alcohol and abuse substances and who and they've gotten themselves, they've got permanent, permanent diseases and issues from living and working abroad. just in, it's insane, the sacrifice that officers make to keep America free. And I'm just not one of those people I chose family."
