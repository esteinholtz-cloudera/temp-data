  "Text": ", you're doing the right thing. What, what I always advocate is the low hanging fruit is what keeps you from being a target of opportunity because you're half assed hackers. You're lazy hackers, you're unskilled hackers. They're looking for low hanging fruit. They're looking for the person who gets the Nigeria email about how you could be getting $5 million if you just give me your bank account, that's what they're looking for. thing that's scary is that if you're not a target of opportunity, if you become a intentional target, there's almost nothing you can do. Because once you become an intentional target, then your security apparatus,, they will and they will create a dedicated customized uh way vector of attacking your specific security apparatus. And because security is always after, right, there's always, there's the, there's the leading advantage and the trailing advantage when it comes to attacks, the leader always has the advantage because they have to create the attack before anybody else can a way to protect against the attack. So the attack always comes first and that means they always have the advantage. You are always stuck just leaning on. This is the best security that I, that I know of. Meanwhile, there's always somebody who can create a way of attacking the best security out there and once they win, they have a monopoly, they have all that time until a new defensive countermeasure is deployed."
