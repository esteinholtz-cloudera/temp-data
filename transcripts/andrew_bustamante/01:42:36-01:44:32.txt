  "Text": "was very rigorous? That was where it became difficult. Everything up to the first interview was easy, but there's three interviews,, and some people are lucky enough to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong or something goes awry with the first few interviews. Uh, and again, this might be dated from what I went through. But, uh, but during the interview process is when they start, they do your psychological evaluations, they do your, uh, they do, um, personality assessments, they do skills assessments. They'll start sending you back to your, wherever you're living assignments, not, not intel assignments but actual like homework assignments, write an essay about three parts of the world that you think will be most impacted in the next 3 to 5 years or, you know, prioritize the top three strategic priorities for the United States and, you know, put it into 250 words or 2500 words and whatever else double spaced in this font, yada, yada yada, like super specific stuff. It's kind of stressful. Uh but it's just like going back to college again. you go through all of those acts and then you submit this stuff to some po box that doesn't have if anybody's ever gonna respond to you. And then you hope you just send it into the ether and you hope that you hope that you sent it right? You hope that you wrote right? Well enough, you hope that your assessment was right, whatever else it might be. And then eventually get another phone call that says, hey, we received your package. You've been moved to the next level of, uh, interview now we need you to go to this other nondescript building and this other nondescript city. And then you start meeting, you start, uh, you start, uh, sitting in waiting rooms with other groups of people who are at the same phase of interview with you, which were some of the coolest experiences that I remember. Still one of my best friends to this day who I don't get to talk to because he's still undercover is a guy I met during those interview processes and I was like, oh we met, I saw what he was wearing, he saw what I was wearing. immediately"
