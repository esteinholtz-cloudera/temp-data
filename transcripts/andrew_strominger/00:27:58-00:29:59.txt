  "Text": ". It was all sort of wonderful century. I mean, the seed of general relativity was the incompatibility of Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field Newton's laws of gravity. They were incompatible. Because you look at Maxwell's theory, a contradiction if anything goes faster than the speed of light. Newton's theory of gravity, the uh field, the gravitational force is instantaneously transmitted across the entire universe. you could, you know, if you had a a, a friend on uh you know, in another galaxy with a very sensitive measuring device that could measure the gravitational field, they could just take this cup of coffee and move it up and down and Morse code and they could get the message instantaneously over another galaxy that leads to all kinds of contradictions. It's not, it's not self consistent. was exactly in resolving those contradictions that Einstein came up with the general theory of relativity. And it's fascinating how this contradiction which seems like maybe it's kind of a technical thing to a whole new vision of the of the universe. Now, let's not get fooled because of contradictions are technical things. We haven't set up the, run into other kinds of contradictions that are technical and they, they don't seem to, they were just, we understood something wrong. We made a mistake, we set up our equations in the wrong way. We didn't translate the formalism as"
