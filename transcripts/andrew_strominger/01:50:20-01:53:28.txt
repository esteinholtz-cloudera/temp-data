  "Text": "So that was a paper with uh Dan Kitz and Alex Lipska that just came out. this is a paper is kind of a wonderful example what happens when you start to talk to people who are, know, way out of your comfort zone of knows different stuff and look at the world a different way and, um some two or three years ago, um I'm, I'm part of this uh Black Hole initiative and I'm also part of this adventurous telescope collaboration that took the famous uh though I had nothing to do with the experiment but uh uh that, that took the famous picture of the, of the doughnut of, of M 87 and um through conversations with them, started out in an effort understand the image that they'd seen. it's a great thing for somebody like me, a theoretical physicist, seemingly lost in string land be presented with an actual picture of a black hole and to be to be asked, what can we learn from this?, you know, with some help uh from uh you know, Michael Johnson and Alex Lapka um and a bunch of other people ventures in collaboration. came up with a fantastic beautiful answer using Einstein's theory um is both shaping the future of now. It is shaping the future of photo black hole photographs. What do you want to concentrate on in the photograph? You know, you just pointed at the sky and click. No, you don't do that. You, you optimize for various features. um it's, it's both shaping that and the process of talking to them and thinking about how light behaves around a black hole. black holes just have so many magic tricks and they do so many weird things. And the photon ring is among the weirdest of them. We understood the this photon ring. And in the process of this, we, hey, this photon ring gotta be telling us something the puzzle of where the holographic plate is outside of a ordinary astrophysical black hole. we nailed it for the stringy black holes, but they have a somewhat different character"
