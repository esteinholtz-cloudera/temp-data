  "Text": "think that with string theory, um don't think it's likely that we could measure it, we could get lucky other words, just to take an example about 10 or 20 years ago, it was thought that they had seen a string in the sky and that it was seen by, um know, uh doubled stars that were gravitationally lensed around the gravitational field produced by some long string. There was a line of double lens. Now the signal went away. OK. But were hoping that they'd seen a string and it could be a fundamental string that it somehow gotten stretched. And that would be some evidence for string theory. There was also bicep two, which was a, the experiment was wrong. But it could have happened, could have happened that we got lucky. And this experiment was able to make direct measurements, certainly would have been measurements of quantum gravity if not string theory. it's a logic, it's a very logical possibility that we could get experimental evidence from strings. That is a very different thing than saying, do this experiment. Here's a billion dollars. And after you do it, we'll know whether or not strings are real. But I think it's a crucial difference. measurable in principle. we don't see how to get here to there. we see how to get from here to there in my eyes, it's boring,? So when I was a graduate student, they knew how to measure the Higgs boson 40 years, but did it, not to say that stuff is boring. I don't want to say that stuff. But I, I, you know, you know, when Magellan set out, he didn't know he could get around the world. was no map, you know. So, I don't know how we're gonna, um, in a concrete way., all these ideas of string theory to the real world. And, know, when I started out in graduate school, I said, what is the, what is the most interesting problem that there might be the deepest, most interesting problem that there might be progress on in 60 years. think it could be, you know, uh that, you know, in another 30 years that maybe we'll learn that uh we have understood how black holes store information, you know, that doesn't seem wild that, that we're able to abstract what we learned from string theory and show that it's operative and,, and, and, you know, I mean, the Bose Einstein con that said they did, you know, they, you when Bose and Einstein predicted it, I, when was that the thirties, maybe early thirties took, they were, there were 20 orders of magnitude that were needed order to improvement in order to measure it. Um And they did 50 years later., and then you couldn't have guessed how that had happened, uh how, how, how they could have gotten that it could happen that we, I don't think we're gonna like see the hetero string spectrum in an accelerator but, but it could be that come around and, and uh an interesting way and it comes together and the fact that we can't see to the end a reason not to do it. You know, we, we're just, you know, what did they do when they were trying to find the specific? Right. They just, they took every route, they just tried everything and that's what we're doing and we're taking, and I'm taking the one that my nose tell tells me is the best, you know, and other people are taking other ones and that's good because we need every, person taking every route., you know, if somebody on another route, uh, find something that looks really promising, you know, I'm gonna make a portage over the mountain and get on their stream, you know. So the fact that you don't the experiment now isn't, to me a reason to give up on what I view as the most fundamental paradox in 20th century 20th, in present physics. 20 21st century physics."
