  "Text": ", you know, if you hit a particle, there were a particle on this table, a big one and you hit it, you might bruise yourself. But if there was a string on the table, you would probably just push it around, and the, the source of the infinities quantum field theories that would particles hit each other. It's a little bit of a, it's a little bit of a, a, jarring effect and, and um never described it this way before, but it's actually scientifically accurate. But if you throw strings at each other, it's a little more friendly. One thing I can't explain is how wonderfully precise. Well, the mathematics is that goes into describing string theory, we don't just wave our hands and throw strings around. And you know, there, there's some very um mathematical equations that describe it. Now, what was realized in the early seventies is that if you replace particles by strings, these infinities go away you get a uh consistent of gravity without infinities. um may sound a little trivial. But at that point, it already been years that people had been searching around for any kind of theory that could do this. And it was actually found kind of uh by accident. there are a lot of accidental discoveries uh in this subject., at the same time, it was believed then that string theory was an interesting sort of toy model putting quantum mechanics and general relativity together paper. But um that it couldn't describe some of the very idiosyncratic phenomena that pertain to our own universe, in particular, the form of so-called parody violation"
