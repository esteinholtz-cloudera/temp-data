  "Text": "said, the inconsistency, right? Something else could have happened. It would have been a major, a major change in the way we think about string theory if it, it was a good thing that, you know, one supposition that the world is made of strings solves two problems, not, not one solves the infinity problem. And it solved the Hawking's problem. also the way that it did, it very uh was very beautiful. It, it gave an alternate description. So description thing of things are, are uh very common. I mean, we could to take a simple example, this bottle of water here is 90% full. I could say it's 90% full. I could also say it's 10% empty. Those are obviously the same statement there it's trivial to see that they are the same. But there are many statements that can be made in mathematics and mathematical physics are equivalent, might take years to understand that they're equivalent might take the invention or discovery of whole new fields of mathematics to prove their equivalent. this was one of those we found an alternate description certain black holes in string theory, which we could prove was equivalent. And it was a description of the black hole as a hologram can be thought of a holographic plate. that could be thought of as sitting on the surface of the black hole. the interior of the black hole itself sort of arises as a projection uh or the near horizon region of the black hole arises as a as a projection of that holographic plate. So the two descriptions were the hologram, three dimensional image and the holographic plight the hologram is what Einstein discovered. And the holographic plate is what we discovered. this idea that you could describe things very, very concretely in string theory in these two different languages, of course, took off and was applied to many uh many different, different contexts within string string"
