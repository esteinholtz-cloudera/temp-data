  "Text": "? I think it's a, logical error to think that string theory is either right or wrong or dead or alive. it is is a stepping stone. uh an analogy I like to draw is Yang Mills theory, I mentioned a few minutes ago in the context of Standard Model. Mills theory was discovered by Yang and Mills in the fifties. they thought that the symmetry of Yang and Mills, Siri the relationship between the proton and the neutron. That's why they invented it. turned out to be completely wrong. does however, describe everything else in the Standard Model it had a kind of inevitability and you know, they had some of the right pieces but not the other ones and they didn't have it quite in the right context and it, it had an inevitability to it and it eventually sort of found its place. it's also true of Einstein's theory of general relativity. You know, he had the wrong version of it in 1914 and he was missing some pieces and you wouldn't say that that his early version was right or wrong. He'd understood the equivalence principle. He'd understood spacetime curvature. He just didn't have everything. I mean, technically you would have to say it was wrong and technically you would have to say Yang and Mills were wrong. And I guess in that sense, would believe just are always keep finding new wrinkles. Odds are we're going to find new wrinkles in string theory. And technically what we call string theory now isn't quite right, but"
