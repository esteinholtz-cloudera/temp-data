  "Text": ". So the soft gravitons and photons um have been uh known about since the sixties, exactly what we're supposed to do with them or how we're supposed to think about them. Um I, I think has been well understood o only recently in quantum mechanics, the energy of a particle is proportional to planks constant times its wavelength. when the energy goes to zero, the wavelength gets goes to infinity. Now, if something has uh zero energy and it's spread all over the universe, what sense is it actually there?, that's been the confusing thing uh To make a precise statement about when something is and isn't there. the simplest way of seeing. people might have taken the point of view that if it has zero energy and is spread all over the universe, it's not there, we can ignore it. Mhm. But if you do this, you'll get into trouble. one of the ways that you'll get into trouble is that even though it has zero energy, it doesn't have zero angular momentum. it's a photon, it always has angular momentum, one, if it's a graviton, it's uh angular momentum two. you can't say that the state of the system with the zero energy photon should be identified with the one the zero energy photon that we can just ignore them because then you will conclude that anglo momentum is not conserved. if angular momentum is not conserved, things won't be consistent. um and of course, you can have a lot of these things and typically you do get a lot of them. when you, you can actually do a calculation that shows that every time you scatter particles, you create an infinite number of them,"
