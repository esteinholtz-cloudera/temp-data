  "Text": ". So it's a very funny thing in physics. The best discoveries seem completely obvious in retrospect, my own discoveries, which of course, are far lesser than Einstein's. But many of my papers, many of my collaborators get all confused. We'll try to understand something we say we've got to solve this problem. We'll get all confused. Finally, we'll solve it. We'll get it all together and um we'll all of a sudden everything will fall into place, we'll explain it and then we'll look back at our discussions for the proceedings of months and literally be unable to reconstruct confused we were and how we could ever have thought of it any other way. So not only can I not fathom confused was before he, when, you know, when he started thinking about the issues, I can't even reconstruct my own confusion from, from two weeks ago. Uh You know, so the really beautiful ideas that physics have this very hard to get yourself back into the mindset. Of course, Einstein was confused many, many things. Um doesn't matter if you're a physicist, it's not how many things you got wrong. It's not the ratio of how many you got wrong. How many you got? Right. It's the number that you got. Right. Einstein didn't believe black holes existed even though he predicted them. And I went, and I read that paper which he wrote, you know, Einstein wrote down his field equations and and Schwarzschild solved them and discovered the black hole solution. Uh Three or four months later, in very early 1916. um 25 years later, Einstein wrote a paper with so with 25 years to think about what the solution means, wrote a paper in which he said that black holes didn't exist. I, I'm like, whoa, know, if one of my students in my general relativity course wrote this, know, I wouldn't"
