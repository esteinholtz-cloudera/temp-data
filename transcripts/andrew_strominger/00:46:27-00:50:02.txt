  "Text": "that is a very interesting story. I was in black holes before I was interested in string theory. I was sort of a reluctant string theorist in the beginning. I thought I had to learn it because people were talking about it. But, you know, once I studied it, I, I grew to love it first. I did it in a sort of dutiful way that these people say they've claimed quantum gravity, I ought to read their papers at least. then the more I read them, the more interested I got and I begin to see, you know, they, they phrased it in a very clumsy way. The description of string theory was, was very clumsy and mathematically clumsy or just the clumsy. Yeah, was all correct. But, clumsy. But it often happens in all kinds of branches of physics that,, people start working on it really hard and they sort of dream about it and live it and breathe it and they begin to see inner relationships and see a beauty that really there. They're not, they're not deceived, they're really seeing something that exists. But you just kind of look at it, you know, you can't, you can't grasp it all in the beginning. And, and, um, understanding of string theory in, uh, 1985 was almost all about, uh, you know, coupled waves of strings colliding and so on, we didn't know how to describe a big thing like a black hole. And so, you know, in string theory, of course, we could show that strings in theory in some limit, reproduce Einstein's theory of General relativity corrected it, but we couldn't do any better with black holes., um, my work with Corman, we couldn't do any better than Einstein and Schwartzel had done., um, one of the puzzles. You know, if you look at the uh Hawking's headstone and also Boltzmann's headstone and you them together, you get a formula their really central equations in 20th century physics. I don't there are many equations that made it to headstones, and they're really central equations and you put them together and you get a formula for the number of gigabytes in a black hole., in Schwarzschild description, black hole is literally a hole in space and there's no place to store the, the gigabytes it's not too hard to. And this really was Wheeler and Beckenstein and Beckenstein and Hawking come to the conclusion that there isn't a sense in which a black hole can store some large number of gigabytes quantum mechanics and gravity can't be consistent."
