  "Text": ", and in fact, one of my, my students has made a really awesome computer animation of this which I'm gonna show at a public lecture in a, in a couple of weeks where the audience will see infinitely many copies of themselves all swirling around the black hole. So, if you, so it's a black hole is like a hall of mirrors, you know, like a department store where you go and there's, there's the three mirrors and you see infinitely many copies of yourself of the black hole as the mirror, know, and you know, you go in there with your clothes. If you want to know about your clothes, you just look at the direct image, you're not learning anything about the configuration of mirrors, the relation, of um image you see in front of you the one you see at the side and the next one and so on only on the mirrors. It doesn't matter what clothes you're wearing. you can go there 1000 times wearing different clothes. But each time there will be the same relation between the subsequent images that is how we're gonna learn about the black holes. We're gonna take the stuff that is swirling around we're going to tease out the subsequent images and look at their relation. there's some very beautiful, beautiful mathematics which we were surprised to realize with the volumes and volumes of on black holes in their properties. This particular it was a physical question that had never been asked in exactly this way."
