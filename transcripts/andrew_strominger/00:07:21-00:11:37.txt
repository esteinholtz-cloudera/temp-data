  "Text": ", light is uh you know, the stuff that comes out of the sun, that stuff that goes into your eyes. Um Light is one of the, the stuff that disappears when the lights go off, the stuff that appears when the lights come on. Um Of course, I could give you a mathematical definition but um or physical mathematical definition. But uh I think it's something that we uh all understand very intuitively. what is light black holes? On the other hand, we don't understand intuitively. They're very weird. of the questions is about black holes which I think you were alluding to is, you know, why doesn't like get out or how is it that there can be a region of space time from which light can't escape? definitely happens. We've seen those regions, we have spectacular pictures, especially in the last several years of those regions. They're there, in fact, they're up in the sky, thousands or millions of them. don't yet know how many. But the proper explanation of why li light doesn't escape from. black hole is still uh a matter of some debate. Um explanation perhaps Einstein might have given that light carries energy. Um You know, it carries energy because, know, we have a photo cells and we can take the light from the sun and collect it, turn it into electricity. So there's energy and light anything that carries energy is subject to a gravitational pull, will pull at anything with energy., it turns out that the graal gravitational pull by an object uh is proportional to its mass. so if you get enough mass in small enough region,, you can uh prevent light from escaping and let me flesh that out a little more. If you're the earth, uh and you're on a rocket ship leaving the, the surface of the earth and if we ignore the friction from the air, if your rocket accelerates up to 11 kilometers per second, that's escape velocity it can, if there were no friction, it could just continue forever to the next galaxy the moon which has less mass, it's only seven kilometers per second., but going in the other direction, if you have mass in one place, the escape velocity become the speed of light. If you shine light straight up away from the earth, it doesn't have too much trouble. It's going way above the escape velocity. um but if you have enough mass there, even light can't escape the escape velocity. And according to theory of relativity, there is an absolute speed limit in the universe, speed of light and nothing any sense. Nothing could be self consistent if there were objects that could exceed light speed. so uh in these very, very massive regions of space time, even light cannot escape."
