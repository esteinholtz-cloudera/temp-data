  "Text": ", something very interesting happens. And solution of the Einstein equation, think his reasoning was ultimately wrong. But let me to you uh what it was the center of the black hole behind the horizon a region that nobody can and live to tell about it the center of the black hole. There's a singularity. And if you pass the horizon, you go into the singularity, you get crushed and that's the end of everything., the word singularity that, um, just means that Einstein's equations break down, become infinite. You write them down, you put them on the computer. When the computer hits that singularity, it crashes, everything becomes infinite. There's two. the equations are just no good there., actually a bad thing. It's a really good thing. And let me explain why. an odd thing that Maxwell's theory Newton's theory exhibit this phenomenon. You write them down, you can solve them exactly. They're really Newton's theory of gravity. They're really very simple theories. You can solve them. Well, you can't solve the three body problem, but um can certainly solve a lot of things about them. Nevertheless, was never any reason, though Maxwell and Newton perhaps for this trap, there were never any reason to think that these equations were exact. And uh there's no equation., are some equations that we've written down that we still think are exact. people still think are exact. My view is that there's no exact"
