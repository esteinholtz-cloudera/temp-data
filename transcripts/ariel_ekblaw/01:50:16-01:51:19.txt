  "Text": ", interesting. Is there a single kind of driving purpose? Why or can it just be curiosity based? I certainly feel and this is not the scientist in me talking but just more of like a human soul talking. certainly feel some sense of purpose and meaning in my life. And there's a version of that. That's a very local level within my family, which is funny because this whole conversation has been big grand space exploration themes. But you asked me this question and my first thought is what really matters to me, my family, my biological reproducing unit. Um But then there's also another purpose like another version of the meeting in my life that is trying to do good things for humanity. that sense that we can be individual humans and have our local meaning and we can also be global humans. Maybe someday like the Star Trek utopia will all be global citizens. I don't want to sound too naive. Um But there is, I think that beauty to a meaning and a purpose of your life that's bigger than yourself working on something that's bigger and grander than just yourself."
