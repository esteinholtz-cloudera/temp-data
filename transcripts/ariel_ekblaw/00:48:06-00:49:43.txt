  "Text": ", we, I don't think we've come up with most of them yet. That's also probably true. That's the thing. It's, uh, I mean, and like, if you look at nuclear war, some of it is physics some of it is game theory, it's, uh, it's human nature. It's how societies built themselves, how they interact,, how we create and resolve conflict. And it gets back to the human question on when you're doing long term space travel, how do you maintain this dynamical system of, of flawed, irrational humans such that it persists throughout time and not just maintain the biological body but get people from not murdering each other like, like each other sufficiently to where you kind of well, but I think, you know, if uh the songs or poetry or books taught me anything, if you like each other a little too much. Um mean, the problems arise because then there's always a third person who also likes and then there's the drama. It's like I can't believe you did that and then last night, whatever. So, and then there's beer and it gets complicated quickly. OK. Anyway, back to the dumb questions because you answered this. There's an interview where you're going to answer a bunch of cool little questions from young students and so on about space. of them was playing music in space and he mentioned something about what kind of instruments you could use to play music in space. Could you mention about the Spotify work space? And if I wanted to do a live performance, what kind of instruments would I need?"
