  "Text": "mean, as an ex-military family, we used to talk about all of this, we would say that luck favors the prepared. so growing up, you know, we had a plan actually a family plan for what we would do in a pandemic, didn't think we're going to have to put that plan into place. And here we are, we do certainly, you know, among my own family and my friends and our work at mit we do think about existential threats and risks to humanity. And what role does space exploration and getting humans off world have to play in a resilient future for humanity. But what I actually find more compelling recently instead of thinking about a need to ever abandon earth uh through a path of space exploration or space voyaging is to see how we can use space technology to keep earth livable. The obvious direct ways of doing this would be, you know, satellite technology that's helping us learn more about climate change or um emitters or CO2. But there's also a future for geoengineering that might be space based. A lot of questions that would have to be answered around that. these are examples of pivoting our focus away from maybe the Hollywood vision of oh an asteroid is going to come. We're going to have to escape earth to let's use our considerable technology prowess and use space technology to save earth and be very much focused on how we can have a worthwhile life for earth citizens. Even if some of us go want to go out and for venturing,"
