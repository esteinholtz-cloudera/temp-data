  "Text": ", a lot of that is also one of the big impressive things that Elon does. I think extremely well is the social media is the getting people excited. And I think that actually he's helped NASA step their game up in terms of social media. There's something about the storytelling but also not like know, like authentic and just real and raw engineering. There's a lot of excitement for that humor and fun. Also, all of those things you realize the thing that make up the virality of the meme is beautiful. You have to kind of embrace that. And um me this kind of uh I criticize a lot of companies based on this. I, I talked to a bunch of CEO S and so on and it's just like there's a caution, like let us do this press conference thing where when the final product is ready and it's overproduced as opposed to the raw, the gritty just show it off. I mean, something that I think mit is very good at doing is just showing the raw nature, the mess of it and the mess of it is beautiful and people get really excited and failure is really exciting when the thing blows up and you're like, oh shit, that makes it even more exciting when it doesn't blow up and doing all of that on social media and showing also the humans it, the individual young researchers or the engineers or the leaders where everything's at stake. I don't know, I think I'm really excited about that. I do want mit to do that more for students to show off their stuff and not be to do this kind of generic official presentation but become a youtuber also show off your raw research as you're working on it in the early days. I hope that's the future things like I was teasing about tiktok earlier. But these kinds of things, I think inspire people to show off their stuff, to show their true self, the rawness of it because I think that's where engineering is best. And I think that will inspire people about all the cool stuff we could do out space. I should say I"
