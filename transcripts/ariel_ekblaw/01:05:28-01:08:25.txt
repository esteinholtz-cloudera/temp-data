  "Text": "we're now talking as there's a war in Ukraine and I haven't been sleeping much. I have family, friends, colleagues both countries. And I'm just talking to a lot of people, many of whom are crying refugees. And I, you know, there's a basic human compassion and love for each other that I believe technology can help catalyze and accelerate. But there's also science, there's something about rockets, there's something about and I mean, like space exploration that, inspires the world about the positive possibilities of the human species. So in terms of Ukraine and Russia and China and India and the United States and Europe and everywhere else. It seems like collaborating on giant space projects is one way to escape these wars to escape these sort of geopolitical conflicts. I mean, there's something, there's so much camaraderie to the whole thing and um even in this little period of human history we're living through, it seems like that's essential. Even through this pandemic, there is something so inspiring about those SpaceX rockets going up. For example, it's true this reinvigoration of the space exploration efforts by the commercial sector. I don't know that was had some, as many of us have sort of some dark times during this pandemic, just like loneliness and sometimes emotion and anger and just and just hopelessness and politics. And then you look at those rockets going up and it just gives you hope. So I think that's an understated sort of value of space exploration is a thing that unites us and gives us hope. Obviously also inspires young generations, minds to also contribute in not necessarily in space exploration, but in all of science and literature and poetry, there's something about when you look up to the stars that makes you dream. And so that's a really good reason to invest in this, whether it's building giant mega structure, which is so freaking cool, but also Mars. Yeah, it's, it's something to look forward to that uh that, that uh not make it a domain of war, but a domain of human collaboration and human compassion. I think you're the founder and director of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative. It includes a ton of projects. So I just want to their focus, I guess on life and space from astrobiology. Like we talked about habitats. Are there some other interesting projects? Part of this initiative that you are pop to mind that you find particularly cool."
