  "Text": "our own thoughts. Yeah, turtles all the way down. Um think that that is a really special gift that we have been given as a species and that there's a worth to expanding our circles of awareness. So we're very aware of as an earth based species, we've become a little bit more aware of the fragility of earth and how special a place it is when we go to the moon and we look back, what would it mean for us to have a presence our purpose in life as a inters soar system species are eventually an intergalactic species. I think it's a really profound opportunity for exploration, for the sake of exploration, a real gift for the human mind."
