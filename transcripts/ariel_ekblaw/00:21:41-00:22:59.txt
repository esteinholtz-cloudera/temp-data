  "Text": "size that we use in the lab, they can really be any size because we can scale them down to do testing and micro gravity. So we sent tiles that were about three inches wide to the International Space Station a couple of years ago to test code, test the state machine, test the algorithm of self assembly. But now we're actually building our first ever human scale tiles. They're me human size a little, you know, a little smaller than maybe your average human. Um but they're 2.5 ft on edge length. The larger scale that we would love to build in the future would actually be tiles that are big enough to form a bucky ball, big open spherical volume, spherical approximation volume. That'd be about 10 m in diameter so 30 ft is much bigger and grander in terms of open space than any current module on the ISS. And one of the goals of this project was to say, what's the purpose of next generation space architecture? Should it be something that really inspires and delights people when you float into that space? Can you get goose bumps in the way that you do when you walk into a really stunning piece of architecture on earth? so we think that self assembly, this modular reconfigurable algorithm for constructing space structures in orbit is going to give us this promise of space architecture that's actually worth living in,"
