  "Text": ", I think it's a great example of this cycle between authors and scientists and engineers that we can be inspired in one generation by what authors dream up, we build it, we make it a reality and then that inspires another generation of really wild and crazy thought for science fiction. I think Neil Stevenson does a beautiful job of being what we'd call a hard science fiction author. So it's really grounded in a lot of science which makes it very compelling for me as a scientist and engineer to read and then be challenged to make that vision of reality, other community, you know, that Neil is involved with and some of my other mentors are involved with that. We are thinking about more and more in the work that we do at MIT is the Long Now foundation. this focus on what does society need to take in terms of steps at this juncture, this particular inflection point in human history to make sure that we're setting ourselves up for a long and prosperous horizon for humanity's horizons. There's a lot of examples of what the long now foundation does and thinks about. But when I think about this in my own work, it's what does it take to scale humanity's presence in orbit, are seeing some additional investment in commercial space habitats. Um So it will no longer be just NASA running the International Space Station. But to really democratize access to space, to have um like Bezos wants to have millions of people living and working in space, you need architecture that's bigger and grander and can actually scale. That means you need to be thinking about how can you construct things for long time horizons that are really sustainable in orbit or on a surface of a celestial body are bigger than the biggest rocket payload faring that we currently have available. And that what led me to self assembly and other models of in space construction."
