  "Text": "think small outposts. Absolutely like mcmurdo, right. So we have these models of really extreme environments on earth in Antarctica, for example, where humans have been able to go and make a a sustainable settlement style life on Mars, probably feasible in the 20 thirties. So we want to send the first human missions to Mars and maybe as early as the end of this decade, more likely early 20 thirties moving anywhere beyond that in terms of a place where like an entire human life would be lived where it's not just you go for a three month deployment and you come back. That is actually the big challenge line. just saying is there enough um technological sophistication that can be brought that far out into space? If you imagine your electronics break, there's no radio shack. This dates me a little bit that my mind jumps to radio shack. But there's no, you know, there's no supply chains on Mars that can supply the level of technological sophistication for all the products that we rely on on day to day life. be going back to actually a very simple existence, more like pioneer life out west in the story of the US. Uh for example, and I think that the future of larger scale gatherings of humans in orbit or sorry in space is actually going to be in microgravity, floating space cities, not so much trying to um establish settlements on the surface."
