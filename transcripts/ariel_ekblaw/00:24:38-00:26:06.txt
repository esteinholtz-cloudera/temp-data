  "Text": "candidates that I would love to build. If we're talking about monumental space architecture, one is what does a space cathedral look like? It can be a secular cathedral doesn't necessarily have to be about religion. But that notion of long sight lines, inspiring stunning architecture when you go in you can imagine floating instead of, you know, being on the ground and only looking up in space, you could be in a central node and each direction you look at all the cardinal directions are spires going off in a really large and long way. So that's concept number one, number two would be something more organic, that's not just geometric. So here, one of the ideas that we're working on an mit in my lab is to say, you instead of the Tessera model, right? Which is self assembling a shell. Could you define a module that's a node, a small node that someone can live in and you self assemble a lot of those together, they're called pleo hadrons like space filling solids and you dock a bunch of them together and you can create a really organic structure out of that. this is the same way that muscles accrete to appear. You can have these nodes that dock together and one shape that I would love to form out of this is something like a nautilus, a seashell, that beautiful Fibonacci spiral sequence that you get in that shape, which I think would be a stunning and fabulous aggregated space station. You said so"
