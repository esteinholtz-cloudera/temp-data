  "Text": "think it should be on the horizon. It's always good to think about these things early because we make a lot of technical design decisions at this phase, working with swarm robots that it would be better to have thought about some of these questions early in the life cycle of a project. is a real interest in NASA right now thinking about the future of human robot interaction. Hr I and what is the right synergy in terms of level of control for the human level of dependence or control for the robot? And we're beginning to test out more of these scenarios. For example, the gateway space station, which is meant to be in orbit around the moon as a staging base for the surface operations is meant to be able to function autonomously with no humans in it for months at a time because they think it's going to be seasonal, they think we might not be constantly staffing it. this would be a really great test of, I don't know that anybody's yet worried about how 9000 evolving, but certainly just the robustness of some of these A I systems that might be asked to autonomously maintain the station while the humans are away. Um or detection algorithms that are going to say, you know, if you had a human pilot, they might see debris in orbit and steer around it, there'll be a lot of autonomous navigation that has to happen. That will be one of the early test beds where we'll start to get a little bit closer to that future."
