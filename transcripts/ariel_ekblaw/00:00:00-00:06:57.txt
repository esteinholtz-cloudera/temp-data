  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Ariel Eglow, Director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative. She's especially interested in autonomously self assembling space architectures, basically giant space structures that can sustain human life and that assemble themselves out in space and then orbit earth moon Mars and other planets. now a quick few second mention of each sponsor, check them out in the description is the best way to support this podcast. We got better help for the Mind Coinbase for the wallet. Indeed for hiring Express EPN for privacy and athletic greens for health, choose wisely my friends and now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle. I try to make these interesting. But if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will too. show is brought to you by Betterhelp spelled he LP. Help. They figure out what you need and match you with a licensed professional therapist in under 48 hours. am a big believer of uh obviously talking as a way to figure out stuff about yourself to dig deep into your past, deep into your subconscious and figure out what trauma you haven't really dealt with. do this podcast partially for that reason. But also in my private life, there's nothing more, don't know, intimate and conversation, just the purity of it, asking the deepest, the honest, most uh delving questions of each other uh of two people, or even strangers to help you figure out something about yourself and better help is easy, private, affordable available worldwide. Check them out at betterhelp.com/lex. That's better help.com/lex. show is brought to you by Coinbase, which is a trusted and easy to use platform to buy, sell and spend Cryptocurrency. I use it and I love it. You can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano Dogecoin and all the most popular digital currencies. believe all of the currencies associated with any of the guests I've had on the podcast so far in the Cryptocurrency space. I love the excitement that people have for these technologies. There's an investment component that I think to me is a interesting. The most interesting part is the technology which I think will revolutionize the way we exchange value, we transact with each other, not just money, just everything. I mean, the the Blockchain Cryptocurrency is, going to be one of the things that the 21st century is remembered for, I believe. Anyway, Coinbase is a great place to get started with all of that and to learn about Cryptocurrency in general, go to coinbase.com/lex to get 10 bucks in free Bitcoin. When you sign up, that's coinbase.com/lex. show is brought to you by indeed a hiring website. I've used them as part of many hiring efforts I've done for the teams I've led in the past. They have tools like indeed instant match giving you quality candidates whose resumes are indeed fit your job description immediately. Uh There's very few things as important as the folks you surround yourself with. Not only do you spend a large amount of your life with the people you work with, you're also actually doing some interesting, challenging things you're going through hardship together. And that's where like incredible bonds are formed. That's where growth happens. And so the team you surround yourself with is essential, not just for the productivity and the effectiveness of your business, but for just happiness. I don't know, II I think you definitely, definitely need to use the best tools for the job. Indeed. It's something I've used many times. I love it anyway, right now you get a free $75 sponsored job credit to upgrade your job post at indeed.com/lux. Get it at indeed.com/lex terms and conditions apply. Go to indeed.com/lux. show is also brought to you by Express VPN. I use them to protect my privacy on the internet in case you didn't know incognito mode on Chrome does not protect you. So your I SPS know all about the shady websites you've been visiting I'm sure the uh shadiness and the spectrum is plentiful. help protect you from that. It can also help uh you change location so that you can access geographically restricted shows on Netflix and Hulu and so on. My favorite reason I use Express VPN is that it's super fast, both in terms of connectivity and sort of responsiveness of the app itself. It works on any device, my favorite operating system, Linux, but also Windows Android, the whole thing, big sexy red button. does one thing does it well anyway, go to express vpn.com/lex pod to get an extra three months free. That's express vpn.com/lex pod. show is also brought to you by athletic greens and its newly renamed A G one drink, which is an all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance. It replaced the multivitamin for me and went far beyond that with 75 vitamins and minerals. I'm just reminding how people are making fun of me for um athletic greens as much as I do. That's OK. That's OK. really is one of my favorite sponsors. It's the uh first thing I drink every day or rather it's the the thing I drink before I break the fast or I guess it counts as the thing you break the fast with fasting, makes me feel good. low carb, makes me feel good and you have to be careful with that stuff to make sure you get the nutrition that you need. And that's what I rely on athletic greens to do to make sure I have that like nutritional base for all the wild things I do in terms of work in terms of food, in terms of exercise and all that kind of stuff., they'll give you one month's supply of fish oil. Another thing I love when you sign up to athletic greens.com/lex, that's athletic greens.com/lex.
