  "Text": "inattention. That's a thing. Oh, wow. I need to look this up but it works. What is that? My sense was if you communicate like confidence in your actions that you're unlikely to deviate from the action that you're following, that's a really powerful signal to others that they need to plan around your actions as opposed to nudging where you're sort of hesitantly, hesitation might communicate that you now you're still in the dance in the game that they can influence with their own actions. recently had a conversation with Jim Keller who is a sort of this legendary chip chip architect, but he also led the autopilot team for a while and his intuition driving is fundamentally still like a a ballistics problem. Like you can ignore the human element it's just not hitting things and you can kind of learn the right dynamics required to do the merger and all those kinds of things. And then my sense is, and I don't know if I can provide sort of definitive proof of this, but my sense is like an order of magnitude or more more difficult when humans are involved. Like, it's not simply a collision, avoidance problem. Where does your intuition? Of course, nobody knows the right answer here. But where does your intuition fall on the fundamental difficulty of the driving problem when humans are involved?"
