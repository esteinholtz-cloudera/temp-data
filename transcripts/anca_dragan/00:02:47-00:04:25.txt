  "Text": "think it was a very gradual process and it was somewhat accidental actually because I first started getting into programming when I was a kid and then into math and then into I decided computer science was the thing I was going to do. And then in college, I got into A I and then I applied to the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon. I was coming from this little school in Germany that nobody had heard of, but I had spent an exchange semester at Carnegie Mellon. So I had letters from Carnegie Mellon. So that was the only MIT said no. Berkeley said no. Stanford said no, that was the only place I got into. So I went there to the Robotics Institute and I thought that robotics is a really cool way to actually apply the stuff that I knew and love like optimization. that's how I got into our bodies. I have a better story of how I got into cars, which is, you know, I used to do mostly manipulation in my phd. But now I do kind of a bit of everything application wise including cars and I got into cars because I here in Berkeley while I was a phd student still for RSS 2014 Peter be organized it and he arranged for it was Google at the time to give us rides in self driving cars. And I was in a robot and it was just decision after decision the right call and it was so amazing. So it was a whole different experience, right? Just I mean, manipulation is so hard, you can't do anything. And there it"
