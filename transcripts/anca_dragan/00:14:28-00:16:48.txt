  "Text": "then talk about how that? Yeah. So by the way, I'm going to talk about this very particular view of human robot interaction, right? Which is not so much on the social side or on the side of how you have a good conversation with the robot, what should the robot's appearance be? It turns out that you make robots taller versus shorter, this has an effect on how people act with them. So I'm not, I'm not talking about that, but I'm talking about this very kind of narrow thing which is you take, if you want to take a task that a robot can do in isolation a lab out there in the world, but in isolation. And now you're asking what does it mean for the robot to be able to do this task? For presumably what its actually end goal is, which is to help some person that ends up the problem in two ways. The first way it changes the problem is that the robot is no longer the single agent acting you have humans who also take actions in that same space. You know, cars, navigate around people, robots around an office, navigate around the people in that office. Um If I send the robot to over there in the cafeteria to get me a coffee, then there's probably other people reaching for stuff in the same space. And so now you have your robot you're in charge of the actions that the robot is taking. And you have these people who are also making decisions and taking actions in that same space. And even if you know, the robot knows what it's what it should do and all of that just coexisting with these people, right? Kind of getting the actions to gel well, to mesh well together. That's sort of the kind of problem number one. And then there's problem number two, which is back to this notion of if I'm a programmer, I can specify some objective for the robot to go off and optimize and specify the task. But if I put the robot in your home, presumably might have your own opinions about. Well, ok, I want my house clean. But how do I want it cleaned and how should robot, how close to me it should come and all of that. And so I think those are the two differences that you have, you're acting around people and what you should be optimizing for, should satisfy the preferences of that end user, not of your programmer who programmed you. Yeah."
