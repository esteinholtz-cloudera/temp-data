  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Anka Dan, a professor at Berkeley working on human robot interaction algorithms that look beyond the robot's function and isolation and generate robot behavior that accounts for interaction and coordinations with human beings. She also consults at Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company, but in this conversation, she is 100% wearing her Berkeley hat. one of the most brilliant and fun roboticists in the world to talk with. I had a tough and crazy day leading up to this conversation. So I was a bit tired even more so than usual, but almost immediately as she walked in her energy, passion and excitement for human robot interaction was contagious. So I had a lot of fun and really enjoyed this conversation. is the artificial intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on Apple podcast. Support it on Patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fr ID ma N usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code Lex podcast. Cash app lets you send money to friends buy Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Cash App does fractional share trading. Let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to the cash app engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the Code Lex podcast, you get $10 and cash app will also donate $10. The first an organization that is helping to advance robotics and stem education for young people around the world. now here's my conversation with Anka Druon. did you first fall in love with the robotics?"
