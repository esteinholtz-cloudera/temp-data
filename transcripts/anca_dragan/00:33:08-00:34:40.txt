  "Text": "? Yeah. So I, tried to find kind of underlying don't know what to even call them. I try to work on, you know, I might call what I do the kind of working on the foundations of algorithmic human robot interaction and trying to make contributions there. And, and it's important to me that whatever we do is actually somewhat domain agnostic when it comes to, is it about autonomous cars or is it about quad rotors or is it about the same underlying principles apply? Of course, when you're trying to get a particular domain to work, you usually have to do some extra work to adapt that to that particular domain. But these things that we were talking about around,, you know, how do you model humans? It turns out that a lot of systems need to benefit from a better understanding of how human behavior relates to what people want and need to predict human behavior, physical robots of all sorts and beyond that. And so I used to do manipulation. I used to be, you know, picking up stuff and then I was picking up stuff with people around and now it's of very broad when it comes to the application level, but in a sense, very focused on, OK, how does the problem need to change? How do the algorithms need to change when we're not doing a robot by itself, you know, emptying the dishwasher? But we're stepping outside of"
