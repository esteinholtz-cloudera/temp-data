  "Text": "think a little bit. Yes. But then this other thing that we can think about is it goes back to what you were saying that interaction is really game theoretic, right? So the moment you're taking actions in a space humans are taking actions in that same space, but you have own objective, which is you're a car, you need to get your passenger to the destination and then the human nearby has their own objective, which some overlaps with you. But not entirely, you're not interested in getting into an accident with each other, but you have different destinations and you want to get home faster and they want to get home faster. And that's a general sum game at that point. And so that's, I think that's what it as such is kind of a way we can step outside of this kind of mode that where you try to anticipate what people do and you don't realize you have any influence over it while still protecting yourself because you're understanding that people also understand that they can influence you. And it's just kind of back and forth is this negotiation, which is really talking about different equilibria of a game. very basic way to solve co ordination is to just make predictions about what people will do and then stay out of their way. that's hard for the reasons we talked about, which is how I have to understand people's intentions implicitly explicitly, who knows. But somehow you have to get enough of an understanding of that to be able to anticipate what happens next. Um And so that's challenging, but then it's further challenged by the fact that people change what they're due based on what you do because they don't, they don't plan in isolation either. Right. So when you see cars trying to merge on a highway not succeeding, one of the reasons this can be is because you, you, they look at traffic that keeps coming, they predict what these people are planning on doing, which is to just keep going and then they stay out of the way because there's no feasible plan, right? Any plan would actually intersect with one of these other people. So that's bad. So you get stuck there. now kind of if you start thinking about it as no, no, no, actually these people change what they do depending on what the car does like. If the car actually tries to kind of inch itself forward, they might actually slow down and let the car in. Um now taking advantage of that. Well, you know, that's kind of the next level we call this like this under actuated system idea where it's an under active system robotics, but it's kind of you don't you influence these other degrees of freedom, but you don't get to decide what there is."
