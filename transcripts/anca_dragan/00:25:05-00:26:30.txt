  "Text": ", good clarification question. So you have an autonomous car and is trying to navigate the road around human driven vehicles. things ideas apply to pedestrians as well. But let's just take human driven vehicles. So now you're trying to change a lane. Well, you could be trying to infer the driving style of this person next to you. You'd like to know if they're in particular, if they're sort of aggressive or defensive, if they're going to let you kind of go in or if they're going to not. And it's very difficult to just, know, when, when, if you think that if you want to hedge your bets and say, maybe they're actually pretty aggressive, I shouldn't try this. You kind of end up driving next to them and driving next to them. Right? And then you, you don't know because you're not actually getting the observations that you get away, someone drives when they're next to you. Um, and they just need to go straight. It's kind of the same regardless if they're aggressive or defensive. And so you need to enable the robot reason about how it might actually be able to gather information by changing the actions that it's taking. And then the robot comes up with these cool things where it kind of nudges towards you and then sees if you're going to slow down or not. And if you slow down, it sort of updates its model of you and says, oh, ok, you're more on the defensive side. So now I can actually, that's"
