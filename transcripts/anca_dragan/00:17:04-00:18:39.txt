  "Text": "is this? Why is understanding humans hard? So think two tasks about understanding humans that in my mind are very, very similar, but not everyone agrees. So there is the task of being able to just anticipate what people will do. We all know that cars need to do this, right? We all know that. Well, if I navigate around some people, the robot has to get some notion of OK, where is this person going to be? So that's kind of the prediction side and then there's what you are saying, satisfying the preferences, right? So adapting to the person's preferences, knowing what to optimize for which is more this inference side. What does this person want, what is their intent? What are their preferences? And to me, those kind of go together because I think that, if you, at the very least, if you can understand, if you can look at human behavior and understand what it is that they want, then that's sort of the key enabler to being able to anticipate what they'll do in the future. Because I think that we're not arbitrary, make these decisions that we make, we act in the way we do because we're trying to achieve certain things. And so I think that's the relationship between them. Now, how complicated do these models need to be in order to be able to understand what people want? gotten a long way in robotics with something called inverse reinforcement learning, which is the notion of someone act demonstrates how they want the thing done."
