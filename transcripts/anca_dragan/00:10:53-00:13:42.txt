  "Text": "really hard? Right. So it depends on what setting. So if you want to do it in this very particular narrow setting where it does only one thing and it's expressive, then you can get an animator, you can have fix the on call. Come in, design some trajectories. There was a, he had a robot called Cosmo where they put in some of these anim. That part is easy, right? The hard part is doing it not via these kind of handcrafted behaviors, but doing it generally autonomously. I want robots, I don't work just to clarify. I don't, I used to work a lot on this. I don't work on that quite as much these days. But, have the notion of having robots that, you know, when they pick something up and put it in a place, they can do that with various forms of style or you can say, well, this robot is, you know, succeeding at this task and is confident versus it's hesitant versus, you know, maybe it's happy or it's, you know, disappointed about something, some failure that it had or I think that when robots move, can communicate so much about internal states or perceived internal states that they have. And um I think that's really useful and an element that we'll want in the future because I was reading this article about how kids are, kids are being rude to Alexa because they can be rude to it and it doesn't really get angry. Right? It doesn't reply in any way. It just says the same thing. Um So I think there's at least for that, for the for the correct development of Children that these things, you kind of react differently. I also think you walk in your home and you have a personal robot and if you're really pissed, presumably robots should kind of behave slightly differently than when you're super happy and excited. it's really hard because it's, I don't know, you know, the way I would think about it and the way I thought about it when it came to expressing goals or intentions for robots, it's, well, what's really happening is that of doing robotics where you have your state and you have your action space and you have your space, the reward function that you're trying to optimize. Now, you kind of have to expand the notion of state to include this human internal state. What is the person perceiving? What do they think about the robots? Something rather and then you have to optimize in that system and So that means you have to understand how your motion, your actions end up sort of influencing the observers kind of perception of you. And it's very, it's very hard to write math about that,"
