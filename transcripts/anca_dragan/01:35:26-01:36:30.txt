  "Text": "I was in a planetarium once and they show you the thing and then they zoom out and zoom out and this whole your respect of dust kind of thing. I think I was conceptualizing that we're kind of, you know, what are humans? We're just on this little planet, whatever. We don't matter much in the grand scheme of things. And then my mind got really blown because they talked about this multiverse theory where they kind of zoomed out. is our universe and then there's a bazillion other ones and it's just pop in and out of existence. So our whole thing that we can't even fathom how big it is was a blimp that went in and out. And at that point, I was like, ok, I'm done. This is not, there is no meaning clearly what we should be doing is try to impact whatever local thing we can impact our communities. Leave a little bit behind there, our friends, our family, our local communities and just try to be there for other humans because everything beyond that seems ridiculous."
