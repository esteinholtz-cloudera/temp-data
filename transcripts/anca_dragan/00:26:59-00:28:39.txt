  "Text": "they're messy and complicated, right? I understand. Um going back to what we were talking about earlier right now, we're kind of in this dilemma of OK, there are tasks that we can just assume people are approximately rational for and we can figure out what they want, we can figure out their goals, we can figure out their driving styles, whatever cool. There are these tasks that we can't. So what do we do? Do we pack our bags and go home? And this one, I've had a little bit of hope recently. And I'm kind of doubting myself because what do I know that, you know, 50 years of behavioral economics hasn't figured out? Um But maybe it's not really in contradiction with what with the way that field is headed. But basically, one thing that been thinking about is instead of kind of giving up and saying people are too crazy and irrational for us to make sense of them, we can give them a bit the benefit of the doubt and maybe we can think of them as actually being relatively rational, but just under different assumptions about the world about how the world works about, know, they don't have when we think about rationality, implicit assumption is, oh, they're rational and all the same assumptions and constraints as the robot, right? What this is the state of the world, that's what they know. This is the transition function, that's what they know, this is the horizon, that's what they know. But maybe, maybe the kind of this difference, the way the reason they can seem a little messy and hectic, especially to robots that perhaps they just make different assumptions or have different beliefs."
