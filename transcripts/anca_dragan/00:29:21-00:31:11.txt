  "Text": "maybe there's something you're missing and it's, you know, especially happens to robots because they're kind of dumb and they don't know things and often times people are sort of super irrational and that they actually know a lot of things that robots don't sometimes like with the Lunar Lander, the robot knows much more. So it turns out that if you try to say, look, maybe people are operating this thing, but a much more simplified physics model because they don't get the complexity of this kind of craft or the robot arm with seven degrees of freedom with these inertia and whatever. So, so maybe they have this intuitive physics model, which is not, you know, this this notion of intuitive physics is something that you studied actually in cognitive science, folks like Josh Denen Baum, Tom Griffiths work on this stuff and, and we found is that you can actually try to figure out what physics model kind of best explains human actions. then you can use that to sort of correct what it is that they're commanding the craft to do. So they might be sending the craft somewhere. But instead of executing that action, you can sort of take a step back and say according to their intuitive, if the world law worked according to their intuitive physics model, where do they think that the craft is going, where are they trying to send it to? then you can use the real physics, right, the inverse of that to actually figure out what you should do so that you do that instead of where they were actually sending you in the real world and I kid you not at work, people land the damn, the damn thing and, you know, in between the two flags and, and all that. it's not conclusive in any way. But I'd say it's evidence that yeah, maybe we're kind of underestimating humans in some ways when we're giving up and saying, yeah, they're just crazy noisy. So"
