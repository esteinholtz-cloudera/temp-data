  "Text": "think what we have to be careful about there is to, it seems like some of these systems, not all are making this underlying assumption that so I'm a driver and I'm now really not driving, but supervising and my job is to intervene, right? so we have to be careful with this assumption that when, if I'm supervising, will be just as safe as when I'm driving like that, I will, if I wouldn't get into some kind of accident, if I'm driving, will be able to avoid that accident. When I'm supervising to, and I think I'm concerned about this assumption from a few perspectives. So, from a technical perspective, it's that when you let something kind of take control and do its thing and it depends on what that thing is obviously and how much it's taking control and how, what things are you trusting it to do. But if you let it do its thing and take control, will go to what we might call off policy from the person's perspective. State. So states that the person wouldn't actually find themselves in if they were the ones driving. the assumption that the person functions just as well there as they function in the states that they would normally encounter is a little questionable. Now, another part is kind of the human factor side of this, which is that I don't know about you. But I think definitely feel like I'm experiencing things very differently when I'm actively engaged in the task versus when I'm a passive observer, even if I try to stay engaged. Right. It's very different than when I'm actually actively making decisions. Um And you see this in life in general, see students who are actively trying to come up with the answer, learn this thing better than when they're passively told the answer. I think that's somewhat related. And I think people have studied this in human factors for airplanes. And I think it's actually fairly established that these two are not the same."
