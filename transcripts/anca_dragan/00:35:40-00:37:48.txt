  "Text": ", right. So it's really interesting and we've seen a little bit of progress on this problem on pieces of this problem. So you can, again, it kind of comes down to how complicated is the human model need to be. But in one piece of work that we were looking at, we just said, OK, there's these parameters that are internal to the robot and the robot is about to do or maybe what objective, what driving style the robot has or something like that. And what we're going to do is we're going to set up a system where part of the state is the person's belief over those parameters. now when the robot acts that the person gets new evidence about this robot, internal state. And so they're updating their mental model of the robot, right? So if they see a car that sort of cut someone off, oh, that's an aggressive car. They know more, right? Um they see sort of a robot head towards a particular door, they're like, oh, the robots trying to get to that door. So this thing that we have to do with humans to try to understand their goals and intentions. Humans are inevitably going to do that to robots. And then that raises this interesting question that you asked, which is, can we do something about that this is going to happen inevitably? But we can of be more confusing or less confusing to people. And it turns out you can optimize for being more informative and less confusing. If you, if you have an understanding of how your actions are being interpreted by the human, how they're using these actions to update their belief. And honestly, all we did is just Bay's rule basically. OK, the person has a belief, they see an action, they make some assumptions about how the robot generates its actions, presumably as being rational because robots are rational, it's reasonable to assume that about them. then they incorporate that new piece of evidence, be sense in their belief and they obtain a posterior. And now the robot is trying to figure out what actions to take such that it steers the person's belief to put as much probability mass as possible on the correct the correct parameters."
