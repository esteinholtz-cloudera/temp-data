  "Text": "thing I, thinking about this question and have a pretty joyous moment because I don't know that I would change much. I'm, I'm trying to make some contributions to how we understand human A I interaction. I don't think I would change that. Um Maybe I'll, I'd take more trips to the Caribbean or something, but I tried to some of that already from time to time. So, I mean, I try to, to do the things that bring me joy and thinking about these things, bring me joy is the Mary Kondo thing, you know, don't do stuff that doesn't spark joy for the most part, I do things that spark joy. I'll do like less service in the department or something like that. I'm not dealing with admissions anymore. Um But no, I mean, I think I have amazing colleagues and amazing students and amazing family and friends and kind of spending time and some balance with all of them is what I do and that's what I'm doing already. So I don't know that I would really change anything."
