  "Text": "imagine you're trying to control some robot that's fairly complicated. You're trying to control a robot arm because maybe you're a patient with a motor impairment and you have this wheelchair mounted arm and you're trying to control it around or one test that we've looked at with Sergei our students did is a lunar lander. So I don't know if you know this Atari game, it's called Lunar Lander. It's really hard. People really suck at landing the same. Mostly they just crash it left and right. OK. So this is the kind of task. Imagine you're trying to provide some assistance to a person operating such a robot where you want the kind of the autonomy to kick in, figure out what it is that you're trying to do and help you do it. really hard to do that for say lunar lander because people are all over the place. And so they seem much more noisy than really irrational. That's an example of a task where these models are kind of failing us. Um And it's not surprising because so, you know, we talked about the forties utility, late fifties, sort of uh noisy. the seventies came and behavioral economics started being a thing where people are like, no, no, no, no, no. People are not rational. People are messy and emotional and irrational and have all sorts of heuristics that might be domain specific and they're just, they're just a mess. So, so what do, so what does my robot do to understand what you want? Um, and it's a very, it's very, why it's complicated. It's, you know, for the most part, we get away with pretty simple models until we don't. And then the question is, what do you do then? Um, I, I had days when I wanted to, you know, pack my bags and go home and switch jobs because it's just, it feels really daunting to make sense of human behavior enough that you can reliably understand what people want, especially as, you know, robot capabilities will continue to get developed. You'll get these systems that are more and more capable of all sorts of things and then you really want to make sure that you're telling them the right thing to do. What is that thing? Well, read it in human behavior."
