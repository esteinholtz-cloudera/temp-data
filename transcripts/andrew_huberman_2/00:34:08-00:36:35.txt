  "Text": "minutes, 20 or 30 minutes because you're going, unless you're sleep deprived, you're going to stay out of rem sleep, eye movement, sleep. If you're sleep deprived, you'll drop right into it. If you've ever traveled and you're really jet lagged, you go to the hotel, you lay down for one second all of a sudden, you're just like you're, you're in a psychedelic dream, um which can be pretty great too. Um But I think that uh 2030 minutes and if you can't sleep, some people have trouble napping, learning to relax the body as much as possible, like trying to remove all expression from your face completely, letting your body kind of float. If people have a hard time relaxing when they're awake. Um There's some terrific uh clinically and research tested hypnosis protocols that we could provide links to that are cost free and that teach you how to just completely the alertness button and you just start drifting. Now, the problem is if you don't have an alarm or something, you go off. You the other day, I did one and I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but there's a component of it where you actually are supposed to let your hand float up because it's a hypnosis script. So they, that's my colleague, David Spiegel in the script. He says, um let your hand float up. I woke up an hour later and my hand was still outing and I was, and I was completely relaxed. hypnosis, hypnosis is just a matter of going deep relaxation, narrowing of context it's all self imposed. A lot of people think that hypnosis is like the stage thing with the pendant and the chicken, you know, people fucking like chickens. But real hypnosis is self hypnosis. You're learning to, it involves some shifts in the way that you, the, the hypnotic induction involves looking up, closing your eyes slowly, deep breath and then imagining yourself floating and people vary on a scale of about 1 to 4 for being the most easily hypnotized. are a few people who it's very hard for them to allow themselves to, to go into these states. But for most people, they just, they're gone. And it's nice if, if you can have access to those states because when you come out of it, you feel amazing, you feel like you slept the whole night. At least most people report that refreshed alert, ready to go. I mean, basically you're ready. Yeah, I know you have this, um, interesting challenge coming up and I'm curious what you're going to do to reset in the hours that the frequency of running is,, every four hours, it's not going to allow you to get any more than a couple of hours sleep in between."
