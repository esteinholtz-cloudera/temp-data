  "Text": ", oh, it makes you irritable, sleep deprivation makes us irritable. It's clear so that in the early part of the night, we get a higher percentage of those old trade in cycles are occupied by slow wave sleep, sometimes just called non rem sleep. And those early night sleep bouts are great for muscular repair and for forms of learning. But rem sleep, the rapid eye movement sleep, which it starts to accumulate and occupy more of those 90 minute old trade in cycles toward the late part of a sleep. Bout so toward typically toward morning. Um But toward after you've been to sleep a while, when you do the emotional processing, that's when we recover the ability to feel refreshed and not irritated by things. And if you deprive people of rem sleep, they become selectively uh bad at, at uncoupling the emotion from things that happened in the previous days. So the little things start to seem like big things. I always know. I'm rem sleep deprived when I'm irritable and when um I look at like the word the and it doesn't look like it's spelled right and I'm kind of pissed off about it like something's off and we actually are becoming slightly um psychotic. When we're rem sleep deprived, you're not gonna get a lot of rem sleep in this thing, except as you fatigue more. If you do fall asleep, you're gonna drop more and more into rem. So that those 90 minute cycles you won't have to go through stage one stage two, stage three and then rem, you're just gonna drop right into rem, you can count on your system to compensate for you. I think that just the knowledge that you tend to get irritable as the time goes on, just that third person of yourself and that awareness, the observer that can be very beneficial because there may be bouts during this event when you just should probably say nothing. maybe you just um I don't know, smile and record or not smile or do, do whatever it is because you're, you're gonna be conserving energy. If it feels like a grind, that's Epinephrine being released. That's Epinephrine that you could devote to the physical effort. humor is an amazing anecdote for this because it resets that it's that dopamine release that gives us that fresh perspective and it's a, it's a real chemical thing. It's not a, it's not a hack, it's not a, it's not a trick, it's not a visualization, it's biology in action."
