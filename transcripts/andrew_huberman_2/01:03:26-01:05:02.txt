  "Text": "are powerful. The relationship between thoughts and hormones and these physiological things is enormous. I had a colleague that a few years ago he was dying of pancreatic cancer and I was interviewing him just because he's an important figure in our community. And I was a friend and there was one day where he, he told me, he said, you know, I don't want to make it past the new Year. I just, and it was, it was crushing for me to hear. I knew that he had been on some androgen therapy um for a, for a whole set of other things. And I, I said, you know, um have you taken your andro androgen cream? And he was like, no, I haven't done it. Go get it for me, I have this on film. He takes it, he puts the andro cream on. I'm not suggesting people take androgens by the way. 10 minutes later, he says, know what? I think I want to live into the New Year. And I'm gonna write 12 letters of recommendation. He went to MIT, by the way, he said, I'm gonna write 12 letters of recommendation and he did. And so there's something about these molecules that in an ancient way, in all organisms, all mammals, as far as we know linked to the will to live, they're linked to effort and making effort, feel good, which has been fundamental to the evolution of our species. I always say people think that the opposite of testosterone is estrogen, but it's not the opposite of testosterone is prolactin which makes us feel quiescent and not in pursuit of things, et cetera, testosterone makes effort, feel good. Estrogen makes emotions feel ok. they are in mixed amounts in people, as I say, of all chromosomal backgrounds."
