  "Text": ". Ok. Well, I thought about this a bit before we met up today. So I think there are two general approaches that could work. one necessarily better than the other one would be to hammer through the whole thing just to get your level of alertness and adrenaline ramped up so that you don't expect yourself to sleep. There are certain advantages. There, one is a subjective kind of emotional advantages, which is if you can't sleep, you're not gonna be stressed about that. And if you do fall asleep, it's a bonus provided you wake up and you don't look up and you realize David's been out running for half an hour and you're behind, right? But chances are, that's not the way it'll go. You set an alarm. So that's one approach, and I grab that from, you know, a couple of friends who were, um, who were in the Seal teams and they'll say that, you know, during buds, there's this infamous hell week and there's this five hour, five days, excuse me, definitely five days of no sleep. Although there is a component where they offer a nap at one particular point. And lot of people will say that it's worse to go down for that nap and then be woken up 20 minutes later than to just stay up. So, so that's one option. Let's call it the um, full blitz hammer through option. And if you happen to fall asleep, you do the bonus. The other one would be to really anchor in these traian cycles. So coming back from a run,, unless you're thoroughly exhausted, you're probably gonna have a few minutes where you're gonna wanna stay awake. It's gonna be hard to just immediately fall asleep and getting as much sleep as you can in the intervening periods provided that you guys aren't posting constantly or doing something else. You also, there's a question of whether or not you wanna nourish whether or not you wanna eat or not in that time. Anytime we put food in our gut, I don't care if it's meat or or broccoli or cardboard, you're drawing blood into the gut. And so you are going to divert some energy towards digestion and it's gonna make you sleepy. There's a reason why the rest and digest the parasympathetic nervous system is called that. So you could decide that you were only going to sleep in certain, in between certain blocks. That would be another way to think about"
