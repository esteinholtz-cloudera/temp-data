  "Text": ", I think there are several things that you said they are important, but I agree that one can have a disregulation sleep schedule and still be a happy person and productive much of my life. I've pulled all nighters and weird schedules. You know, I think many people can probably relate to going to sleep, waking up four hours later, being up for an hour or two on your computer, then going back to sleep and getting amazing sleep the next day functioning. I think we've, I think it's important that people have highlighted the importance of sleep and getting enough rest. do think it's gone too far and now I'm editorializing a little bit, but I think that we've created this anxiety about sleep that it's go if we don't sleep enough, we're gonna get dementia. If we don't get sleep, then, uh you know, the reproductive access is gonna, you know, completely crash. Um know, there's a lot of evidence to the contrary and as well, just based on personal experience and based on the fact that sure that it may be that a solid eight hours with no in uh interruptions in there or nine or 10 could do great benefit. But you can do really well. If you do what you say, which is you wake up, you don't want to start stressing about it, creating this meta stress about sleep happy. It is actually one of the most powerful things that you can do. Not allowing yourself to go down that rabbit hole of stress. For the following reason. lot of our fatigue is not due just to the build up of adenosine or time of day. The circadian thing we were talking about earlier, an additional factor is that effort is in related to the release of epinephrine of adrenaline in our brain and body. some point, those levels get so high that we get stressed mentally, we get stressed physically and we wanna give up. There are good data published in cell showing that that signal, the epinephrine signal is eventually accumulates and there's a a quick point dopamine the molecule of pursuit and reward and feeling good, resets our ability to be in effort. In fact, lot of people don't know this but dopamine is actually what E epinephrine is made from. If you look at the biochemical cascade, it starts with tyrosine, which is rich in re found in red meats and things of that sort. And tyrosine is eventually converted through things like l dopa into dopamine, dopamine is made into epinephrine. So, I mean, this sounds kind of new A G but happiness, joy and pleasure in what you're doing a chemical milieu provides more of the chemicals that allow for effort. And there's nothing new about that. It's in every biochemistry textbook, it's in every decent neuroscience textbook. They just don't talk about the happiness part, they just talk about the dopamine part. So I think that limiting your stress and at least recognizing, ok, if you're pulling it all night or you're somehow on messed up sleep, there is going to be a point in that 24 hour cycle where your brain is not trustworthy, where your mental state is not placing too much weight on because you are near that temperature minimum and near that temperature minimum, which is correlates to that two hour, about two hours before you would normally wake up. The brain is, is hobbling along and anything you feel or think at that time should not be given too much value. if you can trick yourself into thinking, that's the pleasure point. You afford yourself a huge advantage. There's a study done by a colleague of mine at Stanford that showed that positive anticipation about the next day events actually is powerful metric for creating quality sleep, even if the sleep is very reduced and, and you'll love this one. And II, a lot of people are gonna, you know, might be critical of this. So I just want to make sure that. So this is work done out of Harvard medical. It was um uh Bob Stick Gold's lab and Emily Hoagland did this study that showed looking at om performance on OM scores.. So organic chemistry, Harvard pretty tough subject, highly motivated. A number of very good control groups in this study, what she showed was that consistency of total sleep duration was far more important for performance on these exams than total sleep duration itself. So it's not that just getting more sleep allows you to perform better, consistently getting about the same amount of sleep, is better for performance at least on oak than just getting more."
