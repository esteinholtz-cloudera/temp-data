  "Text": ", blink frequency is going to increase as people get tired. Right. Um, I've actually been teased a lot online because I don't blink much I'll do a post and I, and so I did a whole post about blinking about the science of blinking. There's some data, very strong data, not from my lab that show that every time you blink it resets your perception of time. They have people do these kind of track a kind of a Doppler like thing. And anyway, blinking resets your perception of time and there's a dopamine mechanism in a in the blink related circuitry of the brain. when people are very alert, they tend to not blink very much when we're sleepy, we tend to blink more and our eyes tend to close. Now, some people are more hooded in their, the way their eyes sit. Some people are like this all the time. There are some very famous people, I'm not going to name them because I might run into them at some point who are like accused of being sociopaths because they don't blink very often, but they might just have high levels of autonomic arousal, just don't blink very much. Um It also depends on how lubricated the eyes are. So, I think within individual you can get a lot of information. I don't think we can say this person's blinking a lot. They're lying, this person or they're tired, this person doesn't blink. They're, they're stressed. I think if you understand that person's baseline, you can get it and presumably,, well, having been on the Joe Rogan experience, I can say when you first sit down there, if you've never been in there before, you're in my day. Is that by the way? Oh my. Well, I bet you, II I will admit to being, you know, first time being sitting down there. I mean, Joe is incredibly gracious, made me feel very comfortable there. But yeah, it's a, it's an intense experience. Um It's a small space too, anytime you enter a small space from a big space in his old studio. Um it you're familiar with the, there's a breaking in period where you're getting to know somebody. And so I'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal front of the podcast were higher than later. So, but once you have a baseline established, you can get a lot of data on somebody simply from blinks. Um Some people averting gaze to if you have both people that's really powerful. This is the holy grail of another holy grail of neuroscience. mainly looked at subjects in isolation. There hasn't been much brain imaging of two people in interacting or even in animal models of two mice or two monkeys interacting, it's all like person scanner bite bar. I mean, if you've ever been in one of these scanner, you're like in a bite bar is very medieval. And"
