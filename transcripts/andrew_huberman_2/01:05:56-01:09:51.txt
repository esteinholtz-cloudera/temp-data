  "Text": "? I can speak a little bit to the science and a little bit of my own experience and then some anecdotes of people that have done very hard, very long duration things and what they've told me. So I just want to make sure I'm separating those out. So people know my sourcing, think now none of this is about the actual long term nutritional benefits of one thing or the other. But if you look at the science on intermittent fasting, it's pretty remarkable. Uh Before I was at Stanford, my lab was in San Diego. One of my colleagues with Sachin Panda at the Salk is phenomenal biologist and researcher wrote a book called the Circadian Code. It's very, very good and, and kind of popularized intermittent fasting. Although there were others that had talked about this before Uri Hoff Meckler talked about the warrior diet. People probably might not know who or he is but he's, he's sort of the originator of the this business of intermittent fasting, eat once a day or limited. Anyway, Sachin has published papers, peer reviewed papers and very good journals like cell and elsewhere showing that limiting the consumption of calories to eight, know, 46 or eight or even 10 hours of every 24 hour cycle and keeping that more or less correlated with the light with when the sun is out, leads to less liver disease, improved metabolic markers, less body fat, et cetera. In the mouse studies, they even gave the mice the choice to eat whatever they wanted as much as they want. As long as they restrict it to a certain period within the 24 hour cycle. They, did great. They, they maintained a healthy weight or even lost weight when they took the same amount of food and they stretched it out across the 24 the entire 24 hour cycle. So this is eating every hour or two hours. The animals got fat and sick. So it's pretty remarkable data. How much of that translates to humans isn't clear. But one thing that's really clear with humans is adherence, right? We could talk a lot about nutrition and some of the problems with the studies on nutrition is that what people will do in a laboratory is often hard to do in the real world, carbohydrate diets just they tend because they tend to focus on foods that have high amino acid content. Like meats, generally, people are less hungry on their those than they are on calorie. Matched diets of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates. Because when the insulin goes up, you get hungry and you want to eat more. So this is not a push for carnivore or a push against one thing or the other. It's just, there are a lot of factors but we know sure that when you're fasted or when you have low amounts of carbohydrate in your system complex carbohydrate, your alertness is gonna go up fast, increases, increases alertness and epinephrine for the sole purpose of getting you to go out and find food. Can you imagine if our ancestors hungry and they were like, oh, I'm too tired to go find food. We wouldn't be here. You'd be like robots or some, one of your, one of your alien buddies will be like running the land. So I think that um if you want to be alert, fasting or keeping complex carbohydrates to a minimum is very valuable you want to sleep and you want to be sleepy, ingesting foods that have a lot of tryptophan, which is the precursor to serotonin. So complex carbohydrates like rice and grains, turkey, white meats. Those things do create a sense of sleepiness. However, there is a caveat and this is one problem with the once a meal, once a day meal, that any time you have a lot of food in the gut. You're increasing sleepiness because you're diverting blood to the gut. It's going to trigger the vagus to signal to the brain to shut down your system and utilize those nutrients can, you know, digest and utilize those nutrients. So, I've done the once a day eating thing. The problem is I eat so much in that meal that I'm exhausted and so it doesn't always lend itself well to the schedule. But so in a six or eight hour eating block for me is a little bit better. do eat carbohydrates. I'm probably one of the few people left on the west coast that actually consumes carbohydrates and will say that out loud."
