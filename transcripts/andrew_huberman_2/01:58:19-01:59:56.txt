  "Text": "it's clearly happening. You know, I've asked there, I have a couple colleagues at Stanford who are doing animal studies. asked around, you know, it's, there's a lot of discussion in the neuroscience community about what the perception of a laboratory is. If they work on psychedelics. I mean, I, I have to tip my hat to the folks at Hopkins. They are pioneers and as um Terry Cows, he's a computational neuroscientist down at Salk says I don't think he was the first person to say. He says, uh you know how to spot the pioneers. They're the ones with the arrows in their backs. Yeah. And you know, it's, it's an unkind world a scientist that's trying to do really cutting edge stuff. My colleague David Spiegel, who studies medical hypnosis. It's, he's got dozens of studies now showing that hypnosis can be beneficial for pain management, anxiety management, cancer outcomes. It's finally, you know, at the point where there's so much data. But people hear hypnosis and they think of stage hypnosis, which is like the furthest thing from what he's doing. And I think body type stuff, hypnosis, uh respiration and breathing. I think the hard science uh walk into the problem is always going to be best to get the community on board and then it's up to people like Matt and um to really, you know, take it to the next level. And as I say, not Kesey out of the game because Kesey basically was taking too much of his own stuff and he started dressing crazy, a banana hats and like you see him, he had the, the magic bus., you know, the day, so like the day I start driving to work in the magic bus, that's the day I lose my job. I'm not into buses or, or, or wearing fruit,"
