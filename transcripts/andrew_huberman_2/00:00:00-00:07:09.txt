  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman. His second time in the podcast. He's a neuroscientist at Stanford, a world class researcher and educator and now he has a new podcast on youtube and all the usual places called Huberman Lab that I can't recommend highly enough. mention of our sponsors master class, online courses for Cymatic mushroom, coffee, magic, spoon, low carb cereal and better help online therapy. Click the sponsor links to get a discount. By the way, Master Class is testing to see if they want to support this podcast long term. if you're on the fence now is the time to sign up. And I'm pretty sure Andrew will have a neuroscience master class on there soon enough though. His podcast is basically a weekly master class in itself. As a side note, let me say that Andrew is a friend and a new collaborator. We're working on a paper together about a topic we're both really passionate about at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning, but that's probably many months away from being published., I'm really excited about this work. He's one of the smartest and kindest people. I have the pleasure of talking to on this podcast. So I hope we'll talk many more times in the future. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on youtube, review it and have a podcast follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. As usual, I'll do all of the ads now. None in the middle. I'll try to improvise and rant a little bit more than I've done in the past. give you time stamps. So if you skip, please still check out the sponsors. It's the best way to support this podcast. This show is sponsored by Masterclass, 100 and 80 bucks a year gets you an all access pass to watch courses from the best people in the world on a bunch of different topics. The list is ridiculous, Chris Hatfield, Neil Degrasse, Tyson Will Wright Carlos Santana Garry Gasparo, Daniel, Nereo, Neil Gaiman, Martin Scorsese, Tony Hawk, Jane Goodall. And he just keeps going like that. kind of interesting that from my perspective, master class created a whole new kind of way to get educated. So you have the MIT courses that I've been a part of and you have open courseware that can teach stuff. Then there's podcasts like this one, then there's like the short form youtube, like five minute, 10 minute clips that educate you on a particular topic. Then you have to just like relax out there conversations with like Clubhouse that you start to see more and more then you have master class, which is essentially you're taking the best people in the world and getting them in a condensed way to explain the thing that they have mastered. The interesting thing is that the people they pick aren't necessarily educators, that they're actually the experts. So it's like getting them to do a TED talk.

It does not. sadly, it does not have any psychedelic properties either. I'll be in fact, talking to a bunch of researchers that are working at psychedelics. I think it's a fascinating angle on which to study the human mind, but that's way out there over the tried and true horse. That is a coffee that I've ridden my whole life. the way, I also like riding horses. These rants are not working out at all. Get up to 40% off in free shipping on mushroom coffee bundles.

If you know what's good for you, you'll go with a cocoa flavor. My favorite flavor and the flavor of champions. Actually, speaking of cocoa, I got a chance to exchange a bunch of messages with the great Joey Diaz. Joey Coco Diaz. He is as Joe Rogan says, the sweetest human being. kind of incredible actually, how much care he has given, how sort of edgy his comedy is. There's so much love underneath that. That is just beautiful. I do hope I get to talk to him on this podcast. Eventually, he's just a special human being. I just felt the love. It was great. Plus I was a bit starstruck. I mean, the whole thing is amazing. OK, go to Magic spoon.com/lex in the description and use code Lex at checkout for free shipping. episode is sponsored by better help spelled he LP help. I hope you don't need help with spelling help. They figure out what you need and match you with a licensed professional therapist in under 48 hours. I've mentioned before that I actually wanted to be a psychiatrist. Uh when I was younger, was a way for me to try to understand the human mind and of course, talk therapy or, you know, psychotherapy was a fascinating tool in my mind of exploring the human mind. And I suppose you can think of podcasts as a kind of psychotherapy. Maybe for me, maybe that's the reason I'm doing this thing in general. But there's also other forms like I'm doing the Goggins challenge. That's a kind of therapy. I'll be alone with my thoughts with a madman, Mr David Gowins. So, in a Freudian sense, I'm sure I'm going to discover something about myself. Something maybe that I don't want to discover, but probably something I definitely need to work through.. Better help is easy, private, affordable available worldwide. Check them out at betterhelp.com/lex. That's betterhelp.com/lex. I think one of the luxuries I have now is there's so many people that want to advertise on this podcast. I'm starting to care less and less in reading the copy they give me, I'm just going to go off script and just speak from the heart. if they want to drop us, they drop us. Who cares? That said I only try to take on sponsors that actually use and love. So if they drop us, I'll genuinely miss them and keep using them. Ok. And now finally, here's my conversation with Andrew Huberman. do humans need sleep? Let's go with a big first question."
