  "Text": ", I think that it's clear there's one facet of neuroplasticity that is very well supported by the research data that hardly anyone is implemented in the real world. And that's the release of acetylcholine from these neurons in the forebrain called nucleus bali. This is mainly the work of uh Mike Merz who used to be at U CS F and some of his scientific offspring, Greg Ren's own and Michael Kilar and others, what they showed was in acetyl, calling this molecule associated with focus in concert, meaning at the same time as some event, motor event or music event or any kind of sensory event immediately reorganizes the neocortex so that there's a permanent map representation of that event. And I I absolutely believe that this can be channeled toward accelerated skill learning. my friend and colleague Eddie Chang, who is now the chair of neurosurgery at U CS F, but also a fine scientist in his own right, just a clinician, he's doing studies looking at rapid acquisition of language using these principles he trained with Merzenich. clear we have these gates on plasticity in the forebrain and they are gated by nicotine and acetycholine transmission. And why that hasn't made it into protocols for motor learning, sport, learning, language, learning, music, learning, emotional learning. I don't know, I think part of the reason has been kind of cultural is that scientists publish their paper and they move on. Merz talked a lot and still can be found from time to time talking about these plasticity mechanisms can be leveraged. But uh he had a commercial company and so then people kind of backed away from it a little bit. I think he was to be honest, I think Merz was ahead of his time and I think the timing is right now for people to understand these mechanisms of plasticity and start to implement them also. You know, it all sounds like becoming superhuman or optimizing or whatever all that. Yes. But also what about kids with language learning deficits or with dyslexia just performance in school in general? You know, I have a deep interesting concern for the future of science and mathematics and in not just in this country but all over the world and more plasticity equals faster, better, deeper learning. if we don't do this, I don't think we're going to get the full reach out of all the machine learning tools either because everyone talks about these huge data sets and but those huge data sets have funnel into human interpretation. I mean, we don't just like stare at the numbers and bask, right? some the human brain I think needs to leverage these plastics mechanisms to keep up with the thing that's happening very, very fast, which is technology development. So that's a long winded way of saying um basal four brain cholinergic transmission and plastics. It allows for plastics in adulthood and allows for it in single trial learning, which is incredible."
