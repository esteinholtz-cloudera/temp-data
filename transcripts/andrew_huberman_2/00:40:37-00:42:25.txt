  "Text": "will increase alertness because high levels of epinephrine in your system from fasting. You just think about fasting or being thirsty you get exhausted. People always think if I don't eat, I'm gonna be tired. No, that the energy that you derive from food is going to be uh used from Glycogen and after a long storage and conversion process. So the food that you eat is going to consume energy to digest. And so a lot of people feel better fasted and presumably throughout history, people have fasted for long periods of time and had to stay up for two or three days. And know, God forbid, if a family member is sick, you can stay awake in the hospital without any trouble. So that alertness system and it's, you know, it's all mental. Um Actually, and then there's a third so you could try and sleep or take care in between. And then there's a third approach, but I didn't come up with it, but David did. So I actually texted him earlier because I had a feeling that I heard that you were going to do this challenge. So I asked David, these are David Goggins words, not mine. OK. One organized is super important. Two you want to waste as little time as possible. Three you need to eat sleep and rehab in as little time as possible so you can sleep as much as possible. Oh, interesting. By the way, this is the first time I'm reading this, four meal prep and gear prep, et cetera are very important. That's um that's consistent with everything I know about military. They, they don't, they don't leave too much to chance. Five. Again, these are David's words. All that said he's fucked on most all that because he'll be interviewing me before or after. I will also be interviewing him."
