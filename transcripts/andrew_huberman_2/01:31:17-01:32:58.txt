  "Text": "discovered in the fifties Chicago. It's intense brain activity, high levels of metabolic activity, dreams in which people report a lot of the theory of mind we were talking about uh Simon Baron Cohen theory of mind is, was actually something that he developed for the diagnosis of au autism. If you take kids, most kids of age 567, you put them in front of a TV screen in, in the laboratory and you have them watch a video where a kid is playing with a ball or a doll then the kid puts it into a drawer, shuts the drawer and walks away and another kid comes in and you ask the child who's observing this little movie, you say, uh what does this second child think? And they, a typical kid would say, uh they wanna play and they don't know where the ball or doll is or they, they, they're upset or they're sad. They want the doll autistic Children tend to say the dolls in the drawer, the the toys in the drawer, they tend to fixate. They can't get in on the event they can't get into the mind of the, they don't have a theory of mind dreams in rem have a heavy theory of mind component. People are after me trying to get me, you can assign motive to other people, I'm afraid. But it's because there's an expectation doesn't tend to happen in slow wave sleep dreams. Now all this of course is by waking people up and asking them what they were dreaming about which from a standpoint of a A I guy or a machine learning or neuroscientist kind of like, but it's the best we've got. But brain imaging what in waking states while people view a movie and then brain imaging while people are sleeping supports the idea that that's basically what's going on. rem sleep is amazing and you're not going to get much of it during your bout with Goggins, but you will"
