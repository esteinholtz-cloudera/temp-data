  "Text": "we record once a week and in the intervening time, I listen to university level lectures. So NIH has a um a bank of lectures, I have some sources of, of recorded university seminars. I'm trying to find the, the points of intersection. So like for four episodes on sleep. It's not like I'm gonna just regurgitate a popular book or take one lecture and just, you know, poach the content. I'm gonna find the overlap in the different elements. also, so what I'll do is I'll generally read 10 or 15 papers and generally those are good reviews, annual reviews and review of Neuroscience, annual Review of physiology, those kinds of things. I'll chase a few references. I'll listen to some youtube videos, but of university level lectures. And then throw all that on a white board. Usually while I work out in the morning, I'll just be working out. I have a gym in my house and I'll uh just put up all these random ideas. I wanna cover that dreams hallucination. And then I take that and I start to eliminate, I draw lines between the common points of intersection. And then from that, I, I distill out an outline and then I basically think about what I wanna say on my walks with my dog I bother a couple of people and blab to them. So I would say each podcast, I, yeah, I, I put in 10 to 15 hours at least of passive listening preparation and maybe five or six of active preparation. So I, I do prepare quite a lot, but it has a certain reward component for me. I to come up at the end with something that's somewhat crystallized for me is just so satisfying. It feel like there's something about my dopamine circuits that just love that. And,, the only pain is that a year later after I've talked about the stuff a bunch of times it's so much more succinct, but that's life, you know, at some point you got to pull the trigger. Well, I"
