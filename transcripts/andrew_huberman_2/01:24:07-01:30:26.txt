  "Text": "of it is very concrete. So, um Matt Wilson who mit um showed in rodents and it's been shown in nonhuman primates. And now it's been shown in humans that there is replay of spatial information during sleep. So initially, what Matt showed was that these little rodents navigate through a maze, there are these cells in the hippocampus called place cells that fire when the animal encounters a turn or a corridor. And that same exact same sequence as replay during sleep. And it turns out this is true in uh London taxicab drivers before phones and GPS were what they are today. The London taxicab drivers were famous for knowing the routes through the city through these mental maps. there have been analysis of their place cell fring during sleep and during wakefulness. And so we are essentially taking spatial information about the location of things and replaying it during sleep. However, it's not replayed so that you remember it all, it's replayed so that if there's a reason to remember it, the links to the emotional system to the of the limbic system and hypothalamus that are relevant like you got into a car crash or a particular location or you lost a bunch of money because you were a cab driver. Uber driver, we'd say nowadays and you were stuck at one particular avenue all day and frustrated and you're getting yelled at by your spouse, that information gets encoded so that you never forget that at that particular time of day and that particular time of year and this thing happened. So context starts getting linked to experience. So there's spatial information absolutely replayed during sleep. And we experience this sometimes as dreams, the dreams that happen early in the night when slow wave sleep or non rem sleep dominates tends to be sleep of very kind of general themes and kind of um location. It's a, it can feel a little bit eerie and kind of strange in not so incidentally, the early phase of the night is when growth hormone is released in the eighties and nineties, there was a drug that was very popular. It's very illegal now called GHB. You could actually buy it at GNC or a store then I never took it, but it was a popular party drug and some people, some famous celebrities died while on GHB. They were also on a bunch of other things. So it's not clear what killed them. But GHB was very big in certain communities because it promoted a massive release of growth hormone and gave people these very hypnotic states. So people go to clubs and they were in these very hypnotic states. It was part of a whole culture that's early night those dreams tend to not have a lot of emotional content or load. That phase of dreaming is associated with the occasional jolting yourself out of sleep because it's somewhat lighter sleep. This the dreams that occur during rem during rapid eye movement sleep and that dominate towards morning are very different. They tend to have little epinephrine is available in the brain at that time, epinephrine again, being this molecule, stress, fear and excitement, you are paralyzed during these rem dreams, you're, you cannot move. There's intense emotion at the level of what you're feeling. And there's so-called theory of mind. Theory of mind is an idea that was put forward by Simon Baron Cohen, Sacha Baron Cohen's cousin. think on the podcast, I mistakenly said that he was at uh Oxford. It's like the cardinal sin. He's at Cambridge, forgive me. I'm not British. But so the dreams in Rem have are heavily emotionally laden. And it's very clear that those dreams and rem sleep. If you deprive yourself of them for too long, you become irritable and you start linking negative emotions to almost everything. Rem the dreams that occur in rem sleep are when we divorce emotion from our prior experiences. it's when we extract general rules and themes. Uh mit seems to have come up a lot today, but it's, it's highly relevant, Susumu Tonegawa, a Nobel Prize for Mio Globulin. But um obviously fantastic neuroscientists as well has shown that the replay of neurons in the hippocampus and elsewhere in the brain is kind of an approximation of the previous episode. And a lot of fear, unlearning uncoupling emotion from hard or traumatic events that happened previously occurs in rem sleep. So you don't want to deprive yourself of rem sleep for too long and those dreams tend to be very intense. Now, epinephrine is low so that you can't suddenly act out your dreams. But interesting is sometimes people will wake up suddenly while in a rem dream and their heart will be beating really, really fast. That's a surge of epinephrine that occurs as you exit rem sleep. So you were having this intense emotional experience without the fear. You were essentially going through therapy in your sleep, self-induced therapy. It's like trauma therapy where you try to divorce the emotion from the experience and then you wake up and some people also have the other component of rem, which is Atonia, which is paralysis. smokers experience this a lot more than non pot smokers. There's an invasion of, of paralysis into the waking state. I'm not a pot smoker, but I have experienced this and when you wake up and you're paralyzed for a second, it's terrifying, but then you jolt yourself alert. So the rem sleep is important for kind of the self induced therapy and forgetting the bad stuff. It's good for uncoupling the emotions from bad experiences. just there are two therapies, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, which is a eye movement thing that shuts down the Amygdala during therapy, not during sleep. And Ketamine, which is a dissociative analgesic, it's actually very similar to PC P Ketamine is now being used as, as a trauma therapy when someone comes into, um, the, er, for instance, and they were in a terrible car accident. I mean, these are horrible things to describe but, you know, they saw a relative impaled on the driving and steering column or something and they will give this drug to try and shut off the emotion system. So that because they're not gonna forget, let's be honest, you don't forget the bad stuff, but it is possible to uncouple the bad events from the emotional system there's all sorts of ethical issues about whether or not that's good or bad to do. But the PTSD is a failure to uncouple the emotion from these intense experiences. So"
