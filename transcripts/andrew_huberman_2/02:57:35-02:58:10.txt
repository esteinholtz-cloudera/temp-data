You're one of the most inspiring scientists, speaking of communicating to the world. So I can't wait to see what you do with the podcast. I'm already a huge fan. I've been telling everybody about it. I can't wait to see you, talk to Joe as well soon and I can't wait to see what kind of paper we write together. Thanks so much for talking."
