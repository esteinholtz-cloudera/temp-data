  "Text": "evidence that eight is better than six, that you could very well do better on six than on eight. There are a few other things that turn out to be parameters for success in this domain. For instance, your entire life, waking or asleep is broken up into these 90 minute Ultradian cycles. If you look at ability to attend or do math problems or do anything, you know, drive performance tends to ramp up slowly within a 90 minute cycle peak and then come down at the end of that 90 minute cycle. And in sleep, we go through the stage 1234 rem, et cetera. We talk more about that if you like those on 90 minute traian cycles as well, your sleep after a 90 minute cycle at the at the near the end of a 90 minute cycle, say at the end of six hours, in many cases, is better for you than sleeping an additional hour, seven hours and waking up in the middle of an Ultradian cycle. And there are a few apps that can measure this based on body movements and things like that, that have you your alarm go off at the end of an Ultradian cycle. And if you wake up in the middle of an Ultradian cycle, sometimes not always, you can be very groggy for a long period of time. certainly do better on six hours than I do on seven. I happen to like an eight hour sleep. It feels great, but I haven't slept an entire eight hours without waking up in the middle of the night at some point in, don't know forever. I can't, I can't remember. It's probably some point in infancy, but, and I function well during the day, I think that that's a big, that's an important parameter is how do you feel during the day? Almost everybody experiences some sort of dip in energy in the late afternoon or what would correlate to their temperature peak? And that's a good time of day to get either a 90 90 minute or less nap or if you're not a napper or you can't nap. Feet elevated been shown to be good for clear out of some of this. Um, the lymphatic system is this kind of like sewer system of the brain that you can clear stuff out. So legs elevated or one thing that I've um I'm a big proponent of and that my lab has been studying is what I I now call NSDR non sleep deep breast. this is just lying down. There are some scripts that we're going to put out there. Soon as a as a free resource, there's some hypnosis scripts that my colleague David Spiegel has put out there as a free resource. But non sleep depress is allowing your system to drop into states of, of real calm that allow you to get better at falling asleep later. And they can be very restorative for cognitive and motor function. There's at least one study um out of Denmark that shows that basal, the basal ganglia, which is an area of the brain that's involved in motor planning and action. One of these 20 minute non sleep deep rest protocols resets levels of neuromodulators like dopamine in the basal ganglia, two the same levels that they were right after a long night's sleep. So I also uh or semi respectfully disagree with the idea that you can't recover lost sleep. What does that mean? I mean that there's no IRS for sleep. So what does it mean to be in debt for sleep if you're falling asleep during the day and you're sleepy, like you're falling asleep? That's a good sign. Of insomnia means you're not sleeping enough at night if you're fatigued during the day, but you're not falling asleep. So you're just exhausted, but you're not finding yourself falling asleep in meetings and in conversation, chances are you're fatiguing your system through something else like long run in the middle of the night in Boston or whatever it is that you're up to lately at 3 a.m. Yes,"
