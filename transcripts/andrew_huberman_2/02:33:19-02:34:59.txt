  "Text": "genuinely inspired by you. We, we had this discussion last time after the podcast recording and it was, it's clear that communication of science cannot be left to the, the existing institutions. And I'm not talking about universities. I just mean that the science section of newspapers is there's some gems there but generally it goes, you know, and I think you really have to know a field order to extract the best things from that field. And my hope is that other practicing scientists and people finishing their phd and postdoc and people who are running labs or working at companies will start to do this. I mean, how amazing would it be? For instance, if, if someone at Neuralink giving us hints about not necessarily what they're developing because that's complicated for all sorts of reasons, but talk to us about what the real challenges of building futuristic brain machine interface are like and, and what the what it means to understand a clinical problem and address it. I mean, I my hope is somebody there might eventually do that, that somebody in the world of um chemistry or synthetic materials or whatever it is will do this in a way that I could understand because I don't have expertise in those, I think would be marvelous. And, um, you were tip of the spear, you were out first. And, um, I'm just, uh, happily trying to, to move along in the direction I'm going. But I, I think the future of science education is online, and I think that's gonna be scary to a lot of existing institutions but it's not about disrupting anything. It's just about trying to do things better."
