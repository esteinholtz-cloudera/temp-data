  "Text": "mean, I hate the word hack like, oh, it's a dopamine hack or it's a serotonin. I don't like the word hack because it's disrespectful to hackers who do a real thing. And B A hack, it implies that it's some sort of trick that you're, you're, you're kind of gaming the system, know, what, what works is mechanism, right? Biological mechanisms were designed to work and they were selected for, to work under variable conditions. And as you know, and I know, and we have great appreciation for the fact that the nervous system was designed to be an adaptive machine so that you don't have to sleep eight hours every night. You can do this thing and things like gratitude allow you to tap into chemical resources that's not a hack. The, the fact that being grateful for something external to the event happens to release serotonin and have a certain soothing effect or uh dopamine and give you more epinephrine and let you go further. That's not a hack. That's actually what allowed the human machine to evolve to the point that it is now, every time, know, an inventor eventually created something that worked and felt great about it, you can imagine that the, the first, you know, air flight felt pretty awesome and motivated those people to go on and do more. They, they didn't just go, oh, you know, yawn and go have a beer. So being able to access the genuine and states of gratitude and reward works, you can't trick the system. You can't pretend that you're grateful for something. But if you can identify or attach yourself to some larger goal or something that's deeply gratifying to you or place it in service to a relative that passed away that you care a lot about. That's not a hack that's accessing the deepest components of your nervous system and um to steal your kind of lingo, you know, there's real beauty there. Right?"
