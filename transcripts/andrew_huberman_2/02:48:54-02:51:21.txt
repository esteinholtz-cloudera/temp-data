  "Text": ". Well, I mean, without knowing, I've never met Elon, but certainly we have common friends in you and in other people that he worked with long ago, the paypal days, all of whom speak very highly of him and show uh express immense admiration for the number of things that he can maintain. I think it's fair to say that he accomplishes more before 9 a.m. than most people do in, in a decade. It's clear and that what he does would dissolve most people into a puddle of tears mostly because of this whole thing. Uh about the brain working hard, to thinking about duration, path and outcome and anticipating outcomes. Given ABC or D A lot of very scripted linear thinking and prediction. that is hard. It's stressful, it requires intense neurochemical output and he's doing that for multiple projects. So presumably he's buffered himself from the coffee maker issues and the little tiny issues, but he is himself unless there's something I don't know, he's walking around in a biological system. He is that's alleged allegedly. So um and I don't want to reveal too much here, but I have a common um coworker and colleague through some contract work. I do that. Uh What I can tell you is that he's accessing the best resources in terms of how to optimize his biology and thinking about that, not just for himself, but for all of neuralink because I think not trying to dodge the question. But I think there's the, there's the scale of the individual, but then there's the companies that he's creating and you've got people there that you could imagine if they're working at 10% better capacity or can focus 5% better for 20% of the day. You're looking at an enormous increase in productivity and a, and a reduction in the time to reach goals which will reduce the amount of stress presumably on Elon unless he goes and starts another endeavor.. So I think it's certainly not healthy for most people. It seems to be where he gets his dopamine hits. I'm also really struck by the fact that he has a family and he has, you know, he maintain, he's got kids growing up in a relationship and all that. So it's super impressive. I think that, I don't know how old is Elon? He's"
