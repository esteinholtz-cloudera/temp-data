  "Text": "brings us into the realm of neuroendocrinology. There's a fascinating relationship between the hormone system and the nervous system and you know, hormones work in general on slower time scales. The definition of a hormone is something is a chemical released at one location in the body goes and acts at multiple locations far away within the body. Pheromone would be between two bodies. like dopamine and serotonin tend to work a little more quickly. There are hormones like adrenaline and cortisol that can work very fast. But here, I'm referring mainly to testosterone, prolactin, prolactin tends to be in men and women tends to make people kind of lazy and want to um take care of young. It tends to throw down body fat so we can stay up late. It's secreted in response to having Children. These are all in humans and in animals, there's a very interesting relationship between and dopamine directly to what we're talking about now. So, dopamine and testosterone are closely related in the pituitary system. And obviously, uh testosterone comes from the adrenals and from the testes. But the the major effect of testosterone is to make effort, feel good. That's what testosterone does. It has other effects too, right? Reproductive effects, androgen parts of the body, et cetera, but it makes effort, feel good. testosterone molecule is synthesized from cholesterol. Cholesterol can either be made into cortisol. A stress hormone or testosterone but not both. So you have a, a limited amount of cholesterol and it gets diverted towards stress or towards test or this pathway where effort feels good. the pathway you want to get into the anger pathway. If we were to just kind of play a a mind experiment here, the anger eventually is gonna divert more of that cholesterol molecule to cortisol and stress and you will be slowly depleting testosterone. Now going into this, have plenty of testosterone. But after a couple days, there have been very interesting studies showing that testosterone doesn't necessarily drop with sleep deprivation. That's a bit of a myth. You need it to replenish, testo, you need sleep to replenish testosterone eventually. But the real question is, are you enjoying what you're doing? here that the work was uh some of the major work on this was done by Duncan French who runs the UFC Training center. He did his phd at Yukon um Stores did a really beautiful phd thesis looking at the relationship between stress hormones, testosterone and dopamine. Really interesting work. And the takeaway from all of this is if you can just convince yourself or ideally, if you can just enjoy yourself, you are going to maintain or maybe even increase testosterone stores, which will make effort, feel good. And to me, aside from neuroplasticity where everything becomes automatic after this experience, to me, that's the Holy Grail when effort feels good. just gets way better and we're not talking about achieving the reward. I'm not talking about the end of this thing. I'm talking about the process of it. Feeling really good. Yeah."
