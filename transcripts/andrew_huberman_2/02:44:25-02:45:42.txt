  "Text": "etiquette on different platforms and how that changes is really interesting. You know how youtube has one etiquette, which is kind of a lot of harshness is tolerated on youtube video comments. Um Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram, Instagram. There's seems to be a little nice. People are really nice. People are really nice for the most part. Um Except for those uh phishing things. I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account poached by those copyright. They come in with those, like you violated copyright thing. There's all sorts of harshness in there that if you think about it in the real world, I like to think about Instagram as if it was the Real World. that comes over and is basically saying like, hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank and I'll get some money out for you? And like, but there's this trust based on the format it comes in that it can almost get past your radar unless you're suspicious. If, if you took comments, like, you know, your post, get a lot of comments and you said you just walk past 500 random people on the street and just listen to what they say. Like, that's ridiculous. I don't have time for that. But the comments somehow take on this importance and this relevance and you feel we, we feel obligated to give them value, right? And so the online communities that the rules really are different"
