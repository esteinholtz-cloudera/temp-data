  "Text": ", there's a lot of cell sequencing stuff. So the broad over at, you know, on in Boston and then on this coast, the Chen Zuckerberg initiative, um what you know, um they did, you know, $3 billion to sequence every cell type in humans and in animals and try and I think their goal is to cure every disease by some date. I don't know in the in the future. Um data sets of gene expression and protein expression that's valuable. I think no one really knows how to think about neural circuits. And what, what is a neural circuit? Um Is it one structure? Is it two structures communicating? I think um this is where I actually think that the robotics is going to tell us how the brain works because it, it's tempting to think that the brain has all these cell types circuits in order to solve specific problems. But it might be that the fundamental algorithm is to create cells and circuits that can solve variable problems. We know in the retina. Just a very simple example is that we've always heard about like cones are for color vision and high acuity and rods are for night vision and and non color vision. But at the dusk, dawn transition, certain cell types switch to do completely different, have a completely different function for viewing starry night versus what they do during the daytime. neurons multiplex and I think building machines that can multiplex and can evolve themselves is going to help us really understand what the brain is doing. We need to tease out the fundamental algorithms we know they're like motion detection and spatial vision and things like that. I think machines are gonna be much faster at that than our understanding of biology and how the brain does that, I'll be out of a job and people like you have a job."
