  "Text": ". Now a friend of mine who's a physician, he says, um who's quite open to this idea that psychedelics could play a real role in in real medicine says, um better living through chemistry still requires better living. And, and I think it's a, it's a beautiful statement. I wish I had said it be um but he gets the credit but plasticity window opens and then as you said, what are you going to do in the two weeks, three weeks, four weeks afterward, because that's the real opportunity. But those psychedelic experiences are really a case of an amplified experience inside of an amplified experience so much so that everything seems relevant. And it's um, it's fascinating. I mean, I my hope is that the A I and machine learning and the brain machine interface and all that will eventually be merged with the psychedelic treatments that an individual can go in, take whatever amount of whatever is safe for them, working with a clinician and really direct the plastics while maybe stimulating the orbital frontal, medial orbital frontal cortex or increasing the observer or decreasing the observer in the brain or decreasing the amygdala. I mean, it's doable, it's doable with magnetic stimulation and it's for shutting down activity and it's doable with ultrasound. Ultrasound now allows very focal activation of particular brain regions through the skull noninvasively. So"
