  "Text": "know what you think, but for me youtube is, that's why I'm sad that Joe left youtube. There's a archival nature to youtube. That's kind of magical. And so I'm really glad you're now you're doing a lot of educational content on Instagram before. now I doing this podcast thing on youtube. It's like Feynman lectures. I'm not saying every podcast, but there will be, you will have some, I could already tell there will be some lectures are like definitive, like really special ones. And there's some aspect that's archival to youtube where at least I hope 20 years from now some kid is going to watch a lecture of yours and it'll create the next Nobel Prize, right? It'll create another dream that then becomes a reality. And that's a special thing um that youtube provides. So I'm really excited that you're on youtube. And at the same time, I'm excited to see where this thing goes because um seems like change is the cliche thing. The change is the only constant in these times because you're paving with this podcast with this creativity. What you were doing on Instagram as well. You're paving the new era of what it means to do science, so actively doing research and actively explaining that research in new media. It's very interesting"
