  "Text": ", everyone's gonna have slightly different basal temperature. The idea that everybody should be 98.6. I mean, that's a myth and there's the theories that body temperature overall has been dropping in the last 50 years or so. II, I doubt that's true for somebody who is athletic like you and is, you know, young and healthy. But basically the, the coldest period of that 24 hour cycle is when you are going to be sleepiest. actually a period within that 24 hour cycle. It's a, it's a time point called your temperature minimum and your temperature minimum tends to be about two hours before your typical wake up time. I'm not saying about the wake up time in the middle of the night where you go use the bathroom or where you set an alarm to go. Ok, flight. I mean if you were to just allow yourself to sleep without a clock for a few days measure when you typically wake up two hours before then is your temperature minimum. And that temperature minimum turns out to be a very important landmark in your circadian cycle because it turns out that if you get bright light in your eyes in the hours immediately before your temperature minimum. 2 to 4 hours or any time within the two or four hour window before that temperature minimum, you are going to what's called delay, your circadian clock the next day, that whole oscillation is going to move forward, it'll make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later. Whereas if you get bright light in your eyes in the hours after that temperature minimum. So let's say for me, typical wake up time is 6 a.m. My temperature minimum, somewhere around 4 a.m. If I get bright light in my eyes, 5 a.m. six AM 7 a.m. going to advance that oscillation so that I want to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier the subsequent nights. So you might say wait, but most nights I go to sleep and wake up at more or less the same time. Why is that? And that's because the same thing is happening on both sides, you are both advancing your clock a little bit. And assuming that you're looking at light in the evening, you're also delaying your clock a little bit. So you get kind of captured in between and then your rhythm more or less oscillates the, at the same period as we say as the spin of the earth. Unless you're like you where you're, I get text messages from you sometimes at odd hours. And I, I, if you're on the east coast, then I know that you had to have been pulling basically in all"
