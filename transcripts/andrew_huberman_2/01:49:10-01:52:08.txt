  "Text": "never tried DMT what allows for hallucinogenic states and it, I mean, DMT is a really interesting molecule. There, there are a lot of people experimenting now with um DMT. Um And just, the way they've described it is as a kind of a freight train through space and time very different than the way people describe LSD type experiences or Psilocybin where time and space are very fluid, but it tends to be a kind of a slower role if you will. Um So it's clear that DMT is tapping into a brain state that's distinctly different than the other psychedelics. And, you mentioned jiu-jitsu and these other communities, I mean, it's, I think it's interesting because jiu-jitsu is a non verbal activity and people get together and talk about this nonverbal activity and they show great love for it in the same way that surfers, you know, I've known some surfers in my time and they will get up at the crack of dawn and drive really, really far to sit in the water and wait for this wave to come. I have to imagine it's pretty fantastic. think that human beings now, of whom are in the scientific community are starting to feel comfortable enough to talk about some of these other loves and other endeavors because they do reveal a certain component about our underlying neurology. I'm fascinated by um the concept of wordless activities in which language is just not sufficient to capture in which feel so vital as a reset as important as sleep. You know, I think that's one of the dangers of the phone is not that you're going to get into some online battle or that you're always staring at the phone is that it's a words as we read things, we're hearing the script in our head. And I think getting into states where we are in a state of wordless, is very renewing and replenishing and just can feel amazing for. And I believe also can help us tap into creative states and allow our neurology to access creative states and sleep is one such wordless period. So of the most interesting things to me are states that one can approach in waking, non sleep, depressed, word lessness through. Maybe it's jiu jitsu, maybe it's for some people surfing, maybe it's dancing, maybe it's just, I don't know, staring at a wall, who knows? But where the language components of the brain are completely shut down. And it has to be the case that drugs are no drugs that the brain is entering starting to states and starting to use algorithms that are distinctly different than when we're trying to compose things in any kind of coherent way for someone else to understand. There's no interest in anyone else understanding what you're experiencing in that moment. that's beautiful. And I think uh I think it's not just beautiful because it feels good. I think it's beautiful because it's important and it's clearly fundamental to our neurology"
