  "Text": "the problem is not really, the problem is about, I've been on the verge of pulling the trigger on, on, on starting a company which will increase the workload significantly. And uh I'm attracted to that of a dream I have, but it's a little bit scary. it can destroy you in, in a, in a lot of ways. There's two, there's two sources of destruction. So, one source a,, for the first time in my life a few, um, ago I think, have gotten, feels like such a noob thing to say. But I've gotten some hate on the internet., I know. Right. But, like I am such an idiot, I'm so naive to. It was, I had the question that I guess a lot of people have when they get hate on the internet. I was like, like mom, why are these people making up stuff about me? You know, that kind of feeling of like, why are you saying that? And, the reason I mentioned that is like, well, if you go, if you want to go and start a business and do as I think people should, when they start a big ambitious business, really try to go big. what does success look like in terms of your emotional journey? You're going to have a lot of people who make up stuff about you who say negative majority. Hopefully if you do a good job will be supportive and but there's still going to be this army of people there. like that, that was scary to me because of how much emotional impact that had on me. Well,"
