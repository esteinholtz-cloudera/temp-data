  "Text": ", um, and we can get right into the meat of this. So I guess we just dove right in. But the, so the the temperature oscillation is the effector of the circadian clock. So every cell in our body has a 24 hour rhythm that's dictated by genes like clock per BM. This is one of the great successes of biology. They give a Nobel Prize to rep and I don't know if Reppert got it, forgive me, but if you got it, Steve, congratulations if you didn't. I'm sorry, I wasn't on the committee. Um Nonetheless did beautiful work, Steve Rapper and others. Um but Mike Rosboch and like other people worked out these mechanisms and flies and bacteria and mammals. There are these genes that create 24 hour oscillations in gene expression, et cetera in every cell of our body. But what aligns those is a signal from the master circadian clock which sits right above the roof of the mouth called the super cosmetic nucleus. that clock synchronizes all the clocks of the body to this general temperature rhythm by way of controlling systemic temperature, which makes perfect sense if you want to create a, a general oscillation in all the tissues and organs of the body use temperature. And so that work on temperature if people want to explore it further was Joe Takahashi, who was at Northwestern now at Ut Southwester in Dallas. And is absolutely clear that humans do better on a diurnal schedule, sorry lex than a nocturnal schedule because you could say well provided I sleep and push adenosine back downhill, which is what happens when we sleep, adenosine is then reduced and provided I am on more or less a 24 hour schedule. Why should it matter that I'm awake when the sun's out? And um, and I'm asleep when the sun is down. But it, it turns out that if you look at health, me, that are strictly nocturnal do far worse on immune function on metabolic function, et cetera than people who are diurnal who are awake during the daytime. And animals that are nocturnal, it's the opposite and animals that are so called crepuscular, which tend to be active at dawn. And at dusk, there is a beautiful system. I won't go down that rabbit hole. But these are animals whose visual systems operate best. They tend to be predators like mountain. They have optimized their waking times for the times when the animals they eat can't see well in those light conditions. But given the rod cone ratios in their eyes, the the mountain lion is picking on. It's like when you see, uh special forces and they're looking through night vision goggles and they have a clear advantage, right? They're seeing in the dark. That's basically what it's like to be a mountain lion as opposed to a bunny rabbit."
