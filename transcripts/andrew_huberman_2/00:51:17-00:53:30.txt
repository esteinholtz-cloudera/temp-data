  "Text": "don't know that, I don't know that ever gets easy. I have a friend Casey, cordial who works with David. He's does some, um,, uh, rehab type stuff with him and he took Casey on a 50 miler and Casey heads like 16 miles into it. He was just like, he, he hit his wall but they, he found it, they, they find it to get, you know, you find that portal. There is one thing I want to mention, there's some very good physiology that can perhaps support the actual running effort. Part, these are very new data we have a study going on uh with David Spiegel at Stanford, looking at how different patterns of breathing can affect heart rate variability, heart rate variability is good. There's this interesting mechanism uh that I think most people might not realize, but that medical students learn that your breathing and your heart rate and your brain are in this really remarkable interplay. It goes like this. When you inhale, this isn't breathwork, we're not going to do breathwork. But when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down, heart gets a little bigger because there's a little more space in the thoracic cavity. And as a consequence, blood flows a little bit more slowly through that larger volume. And there's a category of neurons, the sin of atrial node that sees that, that recognizes that that slower rate that larger volume. It sends a signal to the brain stem and the brain stem sends a signal back to the heart to speed the heart up. So every time you inhale, you're in speeding the heart up. When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up, the heart gets a little smaller. The volume is smaller, blood flows more quickly through the heart signal sent up to the brain. And the brain sends a signal back to slow the heart down. This is the basis of heart rate variability. at any point, if you feel like your heart is racing and you feel like you're working too hard per unit of effort, focus on making your exhales longer or more intense than your inhales. If ever you feel like you're truly flagging, you do not have the energy to get up. It's like, ok, it's time to go and you're exhausted, want to draw more oxygen into the system, get your heart rate going faster. Now, some people when they hear this probably think, well, this is really obvious, but there's so much out there about breathwork and how to breathe and all this stuff. But no one talks about how to do it in real time while you're exerting effort. So this is"
