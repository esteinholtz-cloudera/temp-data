  "Text": ", nasal breathing, there's a lot of excitement now, obviously about nasal breathing because of James Nestor's book breath. Um There was also if people are gonna know about that book that I do feel like out of respect for my colleagues. There was a book by Sandra um Khan and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford, both professors at Stanford with a forward by um Jared Robert Sapolsky. So some heavy hitters in this book and the book is called Jaws a Hidden Epidemic. And it's all about how nasal breathing is better for us, especially kids than being mouth breathers under most conditions for sake of improving immunity. It turns out there's a microbiome in the nose, like all sorts of good stuff about nasal breathing preferentially. But when we exercise, can, you can do pure nasal breathing. But the problem is once you get up to kind of 3rd and 4th and 5th gear effort, you can't nasal breathe and be at maximum capacity unless you've been training it for a very long time. So I would say double inhale through the nose, offload through the mouth. So double inhale, exhale while you're in steady effort. And then if you really feel like you need to gas it and you're pushing the data show that then just use whatever's there, right? Just go into kind of default mode because too much concentration of something is also going to spend epinephrine. The goal is to get into that. I don't like the word but the flow state where you're not thinking too much, you're just in exertion. these are so these are things that can help in the transitions. Um But I don't think there's any secret breathing technique. You know, anyone who's been in the Seal teams will kind of, you know, they'll tell you like there's no breathing technique, right? There's a, there's tools that you can look to from time to time and these double inhale, exhales can be great for setting heart rate ability in very quickly and getting into a steady cadence while you're exercising. But if there's a sprint, like if suddenly you guys are sprinting, ditch the ditch, the double inhale exhale and just sprint."
