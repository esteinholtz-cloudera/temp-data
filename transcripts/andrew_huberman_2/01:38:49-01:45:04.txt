  "Text": ", I loved your discussion with Matthew. I knew of the Hopkins group and the stuff they were doing, but I didn't know much about it at all. And I learned a ton from that podcast. I reached out to him just to say, love what you're doing. I think it's incredible. So, yeah, your podcast has been a great source of uh serious academic and intellectual um conversation for me. Um I think what they're doing at Hopkins is amazing. Um He has a collaborator there. Actually, they had a very popular paper. I just throw out there for fun. Um Who was a postdoc at Stanford. Her name is Gul. Um She's Turkish, I believe. Um And, and I, I apologize. Her last name escapes me at the moment, but that's just a function of my brain. Um She had a paper showing that uh she put octopi on MD MA on ecstasy and found out this is published in, in a, in current biology showing it was a great journal showing that the octopi then wanted to spend more time with other octopi. They started cuddling. there are colleagues out there. But um the, the Hopkins project is super interesting because I think they were initially supported mainly through private philanthropy. And now you're starting to see some more interest at the level of NIH about psychedelics. a complicated space because psych psychedelics are always looked at through the lens of the sixties and people losing their mind. And there's a, you know, in, I always say, you know, you don't want a Ken Kesey out of the game. You know, Ken Kesey was amazing, right? Part of the whole beat generation thing. And he was actually at the VA near Stanford. That's where he eventually in Menlo Park. He wrote One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest or maybe that was about him. Anyway, the comments will tell me how wrong I am but it's, I think I'm tossing these words in the general in the right general direction. But, know, Huxley Kesey, they did a lot of LSD and they all lost their jobs, right. They lost their jobs at big institutions like Harvard and Stanford and elsewhere or they left, um, because they, they made themselves the experiments, Hopkins as far as I know is one of the first places, if not the first place where whatever Matt may or may not be doing in his own life. I don't know really about the patients and whether or not the patients in these um institutional review board approved studies, whether or not they're getting better in situations like depression, I think clear that there's a very close relationship between hallucinogenic states and dreaming of the sort that would describe for rem dreaming. And there's a terrific set of books and body of scientific literature from a guy named Alan Hobson who was an MD is at Harvard Med and he wrote books like Dream Drugstore. Um One of the first neuroscience books I ever read was about hallucinations and how psychedelics and dreaming are very similar. That was way back when I was in high school, I was just curious he really understood the relationship between LSD and rem dreams and how similar they are. I think psychedelics and Matt knows way more about this than I do, of course. But psychedelics some very interesting properties they are certainly not for everybody. Right. And kids, it's a problem. You know, the, I think the major issues right now around the psychedelic conversation is that it's clear that they can unveil certain elements of neuroplasticity. They make the brain amenable to change, changing up spacetime relationships, changing up the emotional load of an event and being able to reframe that it's clear that happens. there's two major issues. One is that people talk about plasticity as if plasticity is the goal. But plasticity is a state within which you can direct neurology. And the question is, what changes are you trying to get to? So people are just taking psychedelics to unveil plasticity without thinking about what circuits they want to modify and how I think that's a problem. I think there's great potential however, for people opening up these states of plasticity psycho dogs or otherwise and directing the plastic changes toward a particular endpoint. And there's a absolutely spectacular paper at a UC Davis published as a full article in nature just a couple months ago that there are psychedelics that are now can be modified. So, chemists have gotten into the game now and modifying to take away the hallucinogenic component where you still get the neuroplasticity components and for a lot of people to be like, oh, well, that's no fun that's not giving you the, the, the wild experience. But I do think that that holds great potential for people that wouldn't otherwise orient towards some of these drugs. So I think it's really marvelous what's happening and what's about to happen. I think there, there is one drug in that kit of drugs that's very unusual like psilocybin LSD, those promote heavy, heavy serotonin release and lateralized connections ramp up, et cetera. Matt talked about all that. But MD MA ecstasy a very unusual situation where dopamine is very, very high because of the, the way the drug is designed, dopamine release, it goes through the roof. So people feel great and they want to move and they have a lot of energy, but serotonin levels are also high and that's a very unnatural state. why MD Ma may, may and I wanna highlight may have high potential for the treatment of certain forms of depression is an interesting question because never before in as far as we know in human history, has there been a possibility of opening up dopamine igic and serotonergic states? At the same time, dopamine being the molecule pursuit and reward and more and more. And serotonin being one of bliss and being content, right where you're at. So it's almost like those two things wrap back on themselves and create this very unusual state. I think the bigger conversation is what to do with a state like that. Like do you, is it about self love? Is it about developing love for another person? Is it about forgetting hate like these are powerful molecules. And I think if the academic community and the clinical community is going to move forward with them in any serious way, I think there needs to be a conversation about what they're being used for,"
