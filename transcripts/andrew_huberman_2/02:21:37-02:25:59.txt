  "Text": ", first of all, thanks for the kind words about the podcast. It was inspired by you. I absolutely, it's, um, that's no b si the last time we met to do an interview for your podcast, we talked a little bit about it and you gave me the subtle nudge that maybe there was a, there was a podcast there and I thought about it and I left and I was just like, I gotta do this thing and you really gave me the encouragement to do it. Uh Your podcast, this podcast is really forged the way you've been tip of the spear on serious scientific, intellectual, yet fun accessible conversation. And so as your colleague and friend and, but I just, even if those things weren't true like this, this podcast was and is the inspiration, there's no question. Yeah, I really like 100%. And when I decided to do the podcast, the Hebrew and lab podcast, I thought really long and hard about what would work best and would be most beneficial, turned out to be the hardest thing which is to stay on a single topic for three or four or more episodes before switching to a new topic I know from the experience of university and teaching in university as you know, as well that always the temptation to pivot to something else. But the drilling into something really deeply is where the, where the gems reside and the, the challenge has been how to make it interesting how to keep people on board, how to give people tools along the way, also stay close to the scientific data. Um I like to think that we're headed in the right direction. It still needs to evolve. But that's been a challenge. Uh I think also am challenged by the fact that there's a tremendous range of backgrounds of listeners. So some people have asked for more names, like more bits and parts of the nervous system and cellular molecular mechanisms and all that kind of thing. And other people have said I don't understand any of that stuff, but I think I'm keeping up. And so unlike a university course where there are prerequisites and everyone's coming to the table with more or less the same knowledge. I have a very limited sense of what the audience knows and doesn't know. that's why I incorporated the feature of the comment section on youtube being a source of feedback. And I do a kind of an office hours like episode every third or fourth episode where I address common questions. And I think that the podcast space in my mind, um at least for the sort of podcast I'm doing a venue for the listeners to be a more integral part of the experience as opposed to just commenting on what they liked or didn't like. So while I like to hear what people liked and didn't like, I also really like to hear about, hey, tell me more about temperature minimums and how they can be used to face shift circadian rhythms or whatever it is. And I realized that I'm probably losing some people along the way, but hopefully at the end of each month because of the way that the episodes are archived, people will come away feeling as if they've learned a ton and they have tools that they can implement. And perhaps most importantly that they're starting to think scientifically about the tons of other stuff that's out there. that's been the challenge and it's still really early days. But um and, and of course, there's also an intentional challenge. I realize that people are busy, not everyone has two hours to listen to a podcast about jet lag and shift work and raising kids and sleep and that kind of thing. I'm not raising kids, but I did a whole thing about babies and sleep with, you know, and how parents can manage their sleep when kids aren't sleeping. it's been um I'm hacking through the jungle of all this stuff, but, and I'll come right back to I it, my inspiration and my, my, my uh North star on this is to a point where the audience that listens to this feels the same way that I do when I listen to your podcast. Like when I turn into your podcast, I'm gonna embarrass you a little bit more by complimenting you a little bit more. Um, but not out of a sadistic thing, but just because when I tune into your podcast or Joe's podcast, I have the same sensation that other people have. Like, I feel like home of sorts. I'm like, I'm familiar with the space and I'd like people to feel comfortable in the space that is the Hebrew and lab podcast, whatever that ends up being."
