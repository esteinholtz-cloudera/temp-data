  "Text": "is like all nonlinearity. But if it's, but the people still have to know how to play their instruments, right there's some early, early skill building that's critical. I mean, you mentioned someone like Elon, I mean, virtue. I mean, he's already a virtuoso. Right? Because, and in so many different domains I've never met him, but it's, it's clear. Right. He, it's not just that he's ambitious and bold and brave and all that. It's all that and, there's clearly a different way of looking at the same problems that everyone else is looking at and people are probably banging their head against the refrigerator and like think differently things. It doesn't work that way. It involved. There's a certain anxiety in for the I'm not talking about for Elon, but I don't have no idea. But I think for somebody who's very structured, very regimented, very linear, the anxiety comes from letting go of those linearity for the person that's very creative, the anxiety comes from trying to impose linearity, right? The, the really creative artist or musician, they're, they seem nuts, they seem like they can't get their life together because they can't. And they, you know, we look at people who are kind of pseudo Asperger's or Asperger's or some forms of autism and they are so hyper linear, but you take away those linearity and they freak out and that's kind of the essence of some of those syndromes. So I think that ability to toggle back and forth between those states is what's remarkable. I mean, because we're here and we're having this discussion. I mean, Steve Jobs is a good example. He probably the best example, somebody who actually talked about his own process about the merging of art and science, art and engineering, humanities and science. Very few people can do that., I, you seem to have a capacity to do that. I, I like you, you know, poetry and you are a I guy like you, there's nothing linear about poetry as far as I can tell. I"
