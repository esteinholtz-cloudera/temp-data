  "Text": "of ideas, overlap of principles. In fact, there is only one or two or three principles which are very, very simple. And then they apply in almost the same way in almost the same way to the different modalities to the different problems. And that's why today when someone writes a paper on improving optimization of deep learning and vision, it improves the different N LP applications and it improves the different reinforcement learning applications learning. So I would say that computer vision and N LP are very similar to each other. Today, they differ in that they have slightly different architectures. We use transformers in N LP and we use convolutional neural networks in vision. But it's also possible that one day this will change and everything will be unified with a single architecture. Because if you go back a few years ago, in natural language processing, were a huge, a huge number of architectures for every different tiny problem had its own architecture., there is just one transformer for all those different tasks. And if you go back in time even more, you had even more and more fragmentation. And every little problem in A I had its own little sub specialization. And sub you know, little set of collection of skills, people who would know how to engineer the features. Now it's all been subsumed by deep learning. We have this unification. And so I expect vision to be become unified with natural language as well. Or rather I shouldn't say expect, I think it's possible I don't want to be too sure because think on the commercial neural is very computationally efficient. A rail is different. A rail does require slightly different techniques because you really do need to take action. You really do need to do something about exploration. Your variance is much higher. But I think there is a lot of unity even there. And I would expect, for example, that at some point, there will be some unification between RL and supervised learning where somehow the RL will be making decisions to make the supervised learning go better. And it will be imagine one big black box and you just throw you shovel shovel things into it and it just figures out what to do with it, whatever you shovel at it."
