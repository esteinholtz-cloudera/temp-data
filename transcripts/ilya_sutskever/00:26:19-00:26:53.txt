  "Text": "think I know I changed my mind. I'd say language is probably going to be harder. I mean, it depends on how you define it. Like if you mean absolute top notch 100% language understanding, I go with language. so, but then if I show you a piece of paper with letters on it is that if you see what I mean is you have a vision system, you say it's the best human level vision system.
