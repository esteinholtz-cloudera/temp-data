  "Text": "key about the planning rather the the key fact about de planning before the planning started to be successful is that it was underestimated who worked in machine learning, simply didn't think that new neural networks could do much. People didn't believe that large neural networks could be trained. thought that well, there was lots of, there was a lot of debate going on in machine learning about what are the right methods and so on. And were arguing because there were no, there were, there were no, there was no way to get hard facts. And by that, I mean, there were no benchmarks which were truly hard that if you do really well on them, then you can say, look, my system, when you switch from, when this field becomes a little bit more of an engineering field. So in terms of deep learning to answer the question directly, ideas were all there. The thing that was missing was a lot of supervised data and a lot of compute. you have a lot of supervised data and a lot of compute, then there is a third thing which is needed as well. And that is conviction, conviction that if you take the right stuff which already exists and apply and mix it with a lot of data and a lot of compute that it will in fact work. so that was the missing piece. It was you had the, you need the data, you needed the compute, which showed up in terms of GP US and you needed the conviction to realize that you need to mix them together."
