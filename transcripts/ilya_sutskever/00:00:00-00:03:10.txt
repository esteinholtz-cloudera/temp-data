  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Ilya Ecover, co founder and chief scientist of Open A I, one of the most cited computer scientists in history with over 100 and 65,000 citations. And to me, one of the most brilliant and insightful minds ever in the field of deep learning. are very few people in this world who I would rather talk to and brainstorm with about deep learning intelligence and life in general than Ilya on and off the mic. This was an honor and a pleasure. conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic for everyone feeling the medical, psychological and financial burden of this crisis. I'm sending love your way. Stay strong. We're in this together. We beat this thing. is the artificial intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars and Apple podcast. Support it on Patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fr ID ma N. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you. And doesn't hurt the listening experience. show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use Code Lux podcast. Cash app lets you send money to friends buy Bitcoin, invest in the stock market with as little as $1 since Cash app allows you to buy Bitcoin. Let me mention that Cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating. I recommend a cent of money as a great book on this history. Both the book and audio book are great and credits on Ledgers started around 30,000 years ago. The US dollar created over 200 years ago and Bitcoin, the first decentralized Cryptocurrency released just over 10 years ago. So given that history, Cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development, but it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money. again, if you get Cash app from the App Store or Google Play and use the Code Lex podcast, you get $10 and cash app will also donate $10 to first an organization that is helping advance robotics and stem education for young people around the world. now here's my conversation with Ilya set together, were one of the three authors with Alex Koski Jeff Hinton of the famed Alex Ned paper that is arguably the paper that marked the big catalytic moment that launched the deep learning revolution that time. Take us back to that time. What was your intuition about neural networks about the representation of power of neural networks? maybe you can mention how did that evolve over the next few years up to today over the 10 years?"
