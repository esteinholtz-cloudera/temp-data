So obviously reasoning like intelligence is a, is a loose gray area term a little bit. Maybe you disagree with that. But, I think it has some of the same elements of reasoning. Reasoning is almost like akin to search, right? There's a sequential element of step wise consideration of possibilities sort of building on top of those possibilities in a sequential manner until you arrive at some insight. yeah, I guess plane goes kind of like that. And when you have a single neural network doing that without search, it's kind of like that. So there's an existent proof in a particular constrained environment that a process akin to what many people call reasoning exists, but more general kind of reasoning. So off the"
