I think it's definitely possible that the neural networks that will produce the reasoning, breakthroughs of the future will be very similar to the architecture that exist today. Maybe a little bit more recurrent, maybe a little bit deeper. But these, these neurons are so insanely powerful, why wouldn't they be able to learn to reason can reason? why can't neural networks?"
