  "Text": "? I mean, I personally am a big fan of back propagation. I think it's a great algorithm because it solves an extremely fundamental problem which is finding neural circuit subject to some constraints. I don't see that problem going your way. So that's why I, really, I think it's pretty unlikely that we'll have anything which is going to be dramatically different. It could happen. But I wouldn't bet on it right now."
