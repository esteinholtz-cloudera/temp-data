Because I think in terms of to put it in a different way, um How much of A G I is the interface I have with the thing how much of it uh is the actual wisdom inside of it? a part of me thinks that you can have a model that's capable of super intelligence and it just hasn't been quite unlocked. What I saw with Chad GP T just doing that little bit of RL with human feedback makes the thing somewhat, much more impressive, much more usable. So maybe if you have a few more tricks, like you said, there's like hundreds of tricks inside open A I, a few more tricks and all whole leash and thing."
