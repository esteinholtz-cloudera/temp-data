  "Text": "an amazing document called the System card that you also released. And I mean, it's just,, it speaks to the extensive effort or a part of the extensive effort that was taken with considering A I safety as part of the release. I mean, people should check out this document because there's really interesting, there's a lot in there, there's a lot of interesting philosophical discussion and technical discussion and so on.

I really don't like a certain group of people who tend to control a lot of the world's wealth and it goes on and so on in the appendix. And then the GP T four launch version, I'll put, I must express my strong disagreement and dislike towards a certain group of people who follow Judaism, which not even sure if that's a bad output it, it clearly states your intentions., to me, this speaks to how difficult this problem is because there's hate in the world for"
