  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Sam Altman, CEO of Open A I, the company behind GP T four J A GP T Dolly Codex and many other A I technologies which both individually and together constitute some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of artificial intelligence, computing and humanity in general. allow me to say a few words about the possibilities and the dangers of A I in this current moment in the history of human civilization. I believe it is a critical moment. We stand on the precipice of fundamental societal transformation where soon nobody knows when but many including me believe it's within our lifetime. The collective intelligence of the human species begins to pale in comparison by many orders of magnitude the general superintelligence in the A I systems we build and deploy scale. is both exciting and terrifying. It is exciting because of the innumerable applications we know and don't yet know that will empower humans to create, to flourish, to escape the widespread poverty and suffering that exists in the world today and to succeed in that old all too human pursuit of happiness. is terrifying because of the power that super intelligent A G I wields to destroy human civilization intentionally or unintentionally the power to suffocate the human spirit in the totalitarian way of George Orwell's 1984 or the pleasure fueled mass hysteria of brave new world where as Huxley saw it, people come to love their oppression, adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think. is why these conversations with the leaders, engineers and philosophers, both optimists and cynics is important. Now, are not merely technical conversations about A I. These are conversations about power about companies, institutions and political systems that deploy check and balance this power about distributed economic systems that incentivize the safety and human alignment of this power about the psychology of the engineers and leaders that deploy A G I and about the history of human nature, our capacity for good evil at scale. deeply honored to have gotten to know and to have spoken with on and off the mic with many folks who now work at open A I, including Sam Altman Greg Brockman. Ilya sets Zamba, Andre Kathi Jacob uh paky and many others. It means the world that Sam has been totally open with me willing to have multiple conversations including challenging ones on and off the mic. I will continue to have these conversations to both celebrate the incredible accomplishments of the A I community and to steel man, the critical perspective on major decisions, various companies and leaders make with the goal of trying to help in my small way. If I fail, I will work hard to improve. I love you all. now a quick few second mention of a sponsor, check them out in the description is the best way to support this podcast.

So simply say if it's the first layer of protection I use in terms of physical security, think this is true probably for all kinds of security. But how easy it is to set up and maintain the successful robust operation of the security system one of the biggest of low hanging fruit of an effective security strategy you can have a super elaborated security system. But if it takes forever to set up, it's always a pain in the butt to uh manage.
