  "Text": "can learn a lot if we can agree on what it is that we want them to learn my dream scenario. And I don't think we can quite get here. But let's say this is the platonic idea and we can see how close we get that every person on earth would come together have a really thoughtful deliberative conversation about where we want to draw the boundary on this system. And we would have something like the US constitutional Convention where we debate the issues and we uh you know, look at things from different perspectives and say, well, this will be, this would be good in a vacuum, but it needs a check here and, and then we agree on like here are the rules, here are the overall rules of this system it was a democratic process. None of us got exactly what we wanted, but we got something that we feel enough about. And then we and other builders build a system that has that baked in within that. Then different countries, different institutions can have different versions. So, you know, there's like different rules about say free speech in different countries. Um And then different users want very different things and that can be within the, you know, like within the bounds of what's possible in, in their country. Um So we're trying to figure out how to facilitate, obviously, that process is impractical as, as stated, but what does it mean close to that? We can get to?"
