  "Text": "like? We do have systems that try to figure out, you know, try to learn when a question is something that we're supposed to, we call, refusals, refuse to answer. is early and imperfect. Uh We're again the spirit of building in public and, bring society along gradually. We put something out. It's got flaws, we'll make better versions. But yes, we are trying, the system is trying to learn questions that it shouldn't answer one small thing that really bothers me about our current thing and we'll get this better is don't like the feeling of being scolded by a computer. Yeah, really don't, you know, I, a story that has always stuck with me. I don't know if it's true. I hope it is. Is that the reason Steve Jobs put that handle on the back of the first imac remember that big plastic, bright colored thing was that you should never trust a computer. You shouldn't throw out, you couldn't throw out a window of course not that many people actually throw their computer out of window, but sort of nice to know that you can. it's nice to know that, like, this is a tool very much in my control and this is a tool that, like, does things to help me. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that with GP T four. But noticed that I have like a visceral response to being scolded by a computer. And I think, you know, that's a good learning from deploying or from creating a system and we can improve it."
