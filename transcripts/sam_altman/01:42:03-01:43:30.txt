  "Text": "want to be clear. I think like these systems will a lot of jobs, just go away. Every technological revolution does. They will enhance many jobs and make them much better, much more fun, much higher paid, they'll create new jobs that are difficult for us to imagine even if we're starting to see the first glimpses of them. But um I heard someone last week talking about G BT four saying that, you know, man, uh the dignity of work is just such a huge deal. We've really got to worry like even people who think they don't like their jobs, they really need them. It's really important to them and to society. also can you believe how awful it is that France is trying to raise the retirement age. I think we as a society are confused about whether we want to work more or work less certainly about whether most people like their jobs and get value out of their jobs or not. Some people do. I love my job. I suspect you do too. a real privilege. Not everybody gets to say that if we can move more of the world to better jobs and work to something that can be broader concept, not something you have to do to be able to eat, but something you do as a creative expression and a way to find fulfillment and happiness and whatever else. Even if those jobs look extremely different from the jobs of today. I think that's great. I'm not, I'm not nervous about it at all."
