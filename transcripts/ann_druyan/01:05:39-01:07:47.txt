  "Text": ". I don't know. It just that the universe is so full of so many wonderful things to discover that it feels like it would be fun. But no, I don't want to live forever. I, have had a magical life. I just, my, you know, my craziest dreams have come true. And I feel, you know, I forgive me, but this crazy uh quirk of fate that put my most joyful deepest feelings, feelings that decades later, 42 years later, I know how real, how true those feelings were. Everything that happened after that an affirmation of how true those feelings were. And so I don't feel that I feel like I have gotten so much more than my share., not just extraordinary life with Carl, my family, my parents, my Children, my friends, the that I've been able to explore the, the, the, books I've read the music ever heard. So I feel like, you know, if it would be much better, if, instead of working on the immortality of the lucky few of the most privileged people in this society, would really like to see a concerted effort for us to get our act together. You know, that to me is topic, a more pressing, uh you know, this possible world that is the challenge and we're at a kind of moment where if we can, we can make that choice. So immortality doesn't really interest me. I, I really, I love nature and I have to say that I,, because I'm a product of nature, I recognize that it's, it's great gifts and it's great cruelty."
