  "Text": "not so true anymore. I don't think our problem a population that's skeptical about climate change because I think that the extreme weather, fire events that we are experiencing with such frequency is really gotten to people. I think they, I think that there are people in leadership positions who choose to ignore it and to pretend it's not there. ultimately, I think they will be rejected. The question is, will it be fast enough? Uh But you know, this, I don't, I think actually that most people have really finally taken the reality of global climate change to heart. And they look at their Children and grandchildren and they don't feel good because they come from a world which was many ways in terms of climate, fairly familiar and benign and they know that we're headed in another direction and it's not just that it's what we do to the oceans, the rivers, the air, you know, I mean, you ask me like, what is, what is the message of cosmos? It's, that is that we have to think in longer terms, know, I think of the Soviet Union and the United States in the Cold War and they're ready to kill each other over these two different views of the distribution of resources, neither of them a form of human social organization that thinks in terms of 100 years, let alone 1000 years, which are the time scales that science speaks in. And that's part of the problem is that we have to get a grip on reality and where we're headed. And it's, I, I, I'm not fatalistic at all. Uh but I do feel like, you know, and in setting out to, do this series each season, we were talking about climate change in the original Cosmos in episode four warning about inadvertent climate modification in 1980. You know, and of course, Carl did his phd thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus and he was painfully cognizant of what a runaway greenhouse effect would do to our planet. And not only that but the climatic history of the planet which we go into in great detail in the series. yeah, I mean, how are we going to get a grip on this if not through some kind of understanding of science? Can I just say one more thing about science is that its powers of prophecy are astonishing, you launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know where each and every planet in the solar system is going to be in every moon you run with that flawlessly and you exceed the design specifications of the greatest dreams of the engineers. And then you go on to explore the milky way galaxy and you do it. I mean, you know, the climate scientists, some of the people that we, whose stories we tell in cosmos, they, their predictions and they were working with very computer modeling capabilities. They have proven to be so robust. Nuclear winter, all of these things. This is a prophetic power and yet how crazy that you know, it's like it's like the Romans with their lead cooking pots and their lead pipes or the Aztecs ripping out own people's hearts. This is us, we know better and yet we are acting as if it's business as usual."
