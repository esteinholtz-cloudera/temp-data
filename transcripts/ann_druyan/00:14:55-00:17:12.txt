  "Text": ". So Voyagers one and two were our first reconnaissance mission of what was then considered the outer solar system. it was a gift of gravity. The idea that swinging around uh these worlds gives you a gravitational assist, which ultimately will send you out of the solar system to wander the milky way galaxy for 1 to 5 billion years. Voyager gave us our first close up look uh Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune, it discovered new moons, it discovered volcanoes on IO it it, its achievements astonishing and remember this is technology from the early to mid 19 seventies and it's still active and it's still active. We talked to Voyager a few days ago, talked to it. In fact, a year ago, I think it was we needed to slightly change the attitude of the spacecraft. And so we fired up its thrusters for the first time since 1987 instantly. It was as if you had left your car in the garage in 1987 and you put the key in the ignition because you use keys then in the ignition it turned over the first time you stepped on the gas. And so that's the genius of the engineering of Voyager. And Carl was one of the key participants in in, in imagining what its mission would be because it was a, gift actually of the fact that every 175 years plus or minus, there is an alignment of the worlds. And so you could send to spacecraft these other worlds and photograph them and use your mass spectrometer and all the other devices on Voyager to, to really, to explore these worlds. And"
