  "Text": "we were both involved with other people. And it was a completely outside morality and mine to even broach the subject. But it was only days after that, it happened. And for me, it was a eureka moment. was in the context of finding that piece of Chinese music that was worthy to represent one of the oldest musical traditions on earth. When those of us who worked on the Voyager record were completely ignorant about Chinese music. And so that had been a constant challenge for me, talking to professors of Chinese music ethno musicologists everywhere and through the project, desperately trying to find this one piece. Found the piece on the Upper West side, found the piece uh a professor at Columbia University gave it to me he's of all the people I talked to, everyone had said, that's hopeless. You can't do that. That there can't be one piece of Chinese music, but he was completely problem. I've got it. And so uh he, he told me the story of the piece which only made it an even greater candidate for the record, which, and I listened to it called Carl Sagan, who was in Tucson Arizona addressing the American Society of newspaper editors. And um I left him a message hotel message center he called me back an hour later heard this beautiful voice I get back to my hotel room and I found this message that Annie called and I asked myself, why didn't you leave me this message? 10 years ago, heart beating out of my chest. I was for me, a kind of eureka, a scientific breakthrough, a truth, a great truth. It's suddenly been revealed. of course, I was awkward and didn't really know what to say. And so I blurted something out like um oh, I've been meaning to talk to you about that Carl, which wasn't really true. I never would have talked to him about it. We had been alone countless"
