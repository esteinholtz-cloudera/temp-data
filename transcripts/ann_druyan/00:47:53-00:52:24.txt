  "Text": "so much me. These are rare occasions for human self esteem. scientists that we to life and cosmos people in my view who have everything we need see us through this current crisis. there very often they come, they're poor, they're female, they're outsiders who are not expected have gifts that are so prodigious, but they persevere. And so you have someone like Michael Faraday who is, comes from a family, dysfunctional family of 14 people. And you know, it never goes to university, never learns the math. But you know, is the, you know, there's Einstein years later looking up at the picture of Faraday inspire him that. So it's, you know, if we had with that kind of humility and unselfishness who didn't want to patent everything, as you know, Faraday created the wealth of the 20th century with his various inventions. And yet he never took out a single patent at a time when people were patenting everything that was not what he was about. And to me, that's a kind of almost a saintliness that says that, you know, here's a man who finds in his life, this tremendous gratification from searching it's just so impressive to me. And there are so many other people in cosmos, especially the new season of cosmos, which is called possible worlds, possible worlds. Well, I stole it from an author and a scientist from the 19 forties, but it, it for me encapsulates not just, you know, the exoplanets that we've begun to discover, not just, you know, the, worlds that we might visit, but also the world that this could be a hopeful vision of the future. You asked me, what is common to all three seasons of cosmos or what is that voice? It's a voice of hope. It's a voice that says there is a future which we bring to life and I think fairly dazzling fashion we can still have. You know, and in sitting down to imagine what this season would be, the new season would be sitting where I live in Ithaca, beautiful, a gorgeous place, trees everywhere. Waterfalls. I'm sitting there thinking, well, you know, you can't, how do you, do you awaken people? I mean, you can't yell at them and say we're all gonna die. You know, it's not, it doesn't help, it doesn't help. But think if you give them a vision of the future that's not pie in the sky, but something ways in which science can be redemptive can actually remediate our future. We have those capabilities right now as well as the capabilities to do things in the cosmos that we could be doing right now, but we're not doing them. because we don't know how to, how, you know, with the engineering or the material sciences or the physics, we know all we need to know, but we're a little bit paralyzed in some sense. And, you know, we're like, I always think we're like the toddler, you know, like we, we left our mother's legs, you know, and scurried up to the moon and we had a moment of, wow, we can do this. And then we realized somehow we had a failure of nerve and we went scurrying back to our mother and did things that really weren't going to get us out there like the space shuttle, things like that because it was a kind of failure of nerve. So cosmos is about those fears."
