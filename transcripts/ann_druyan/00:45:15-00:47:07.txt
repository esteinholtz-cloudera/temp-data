  "Text": ". Saying no. And my partners, I'm sure, you know, I know they would look at me like I was nuts, you know, and they probably must have entertained the idea that maybe I didn't really want to do it, you know, because I was afraid or something. But I kept saying no. And it wasn't until I met Seth mcfarlane and he took me to Fox Peter Rice and said, you know, I'll pay for half the pilot if I have to, you know, and Peter Rice was like, put your money away and said that, yeah. And uh, and, and, and in every time since in the, in the 10 years since at every turn, when we needed Seth to intervene on our behalf, he stood up and he did it. And so that was like in a way that is the, know, the watershed for me of the everything that followed since. And then I was so lucky because I know Steve and I Steve Soter and I written the original Cosmos with Carl and we collab collaborated on the treatment for a season two. And then Brandon Braga came into our uh project the perfect moment and has proven to be the, just the really, I have been so lucky my whole life, I've collaborated, I've been lucky with the pe my collaborators have been extraordinary. so that was a critical thing. But also to have, you know, for instance, uh astonishing V FX supervisor who comes from the movies who heads the Global Association of V FX people, Jeff. OK. And uh and then, and, and, you know, I can rattle off 10 more names. I'd be happy to do that. And was that collaboration."
