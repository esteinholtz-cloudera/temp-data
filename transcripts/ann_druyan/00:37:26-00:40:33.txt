  "Text": ". Well, the dream of cosmos is really Einstein's quote. You know, it's the idea of the awesome power of science be in absolutely everyone's hands, you know, it belongs to all of us. It's not the preserve of a priesthood. It's just as the community of science is becoming more diverse and being less exclusive than it was guilty of. In the not so recent past, discoveries of science, our understanding of the cosmos that we live in has uh really grown by leaps and bounds. And probably learned more in the last 100 years about it. Uh you know, the the the tempo of discovery has picked up so rapidly. And so idea of cosmos from the 19 seventies when Carl and I and Steven Soter, another astronomer first imagined it was that interweaving not only of these scientific concepts and revelations and using, you know, cinematic V FX to take the viewer on this transporting, uplifting journey, but also the stories of the searchers. the more I have learned about the process of science through my life with Carl and sense, the more I am uh persuaded that it's that adherence to the facts. and to that adherence to that little approximation, that little bit of reality that we've been able to get our hands around something that we desperately need. And it doesn't matter if you are a scientist. In fact, the people, it matters even more if you're not. And since, you know, the level of science teaching has been fairly or unfairly maligned. the idea that once there was such a thing as a television network, which of course has now evolved into many other things, idea that you could in the most democratic way, make accessible to absolutely everyone and most especially people who don't even realize they have an interest in the subject or who feel so intimidated by the jargon of science. And it's kind of exclusive history, the idea that we could do this. And, you know, in season two of Cosmos spacetime Odyssey, were in 100 and 81 countries in the space of two weeks. It was the largest roll out in television history, which is really amazing for there is no science based program"
