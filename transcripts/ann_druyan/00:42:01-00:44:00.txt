  "Text": ". I would love to do that sentence because I because that's the the greatest gratification because that's the dream of science. And that's the whole idea is that if it belongs to all of us and not just a tiny few, then we have some chance of determining how it's used. And if it's only in the hands of people whose only, whose only interest the balance sheet or hegemony over other nations or things like that, then it'll probably end up being a gun aimed at our heads. But if it's distributed in the widest possible way, a capability that we now have because of our technology, then the chance is that um it will be used with wisdom that that's the dream of it. So that's that's why we did the first cosmos. We wanted to take, not just as I say, the scientific information, but also tell the stories of these searchers. Because for us and for me in carrying on this series in the 2nd and 3rd seasons, the, the, primary interest was that we wouldn't tell a story unless it was a kind of a three for, you know, it was not just a way to understand a new sign, a scientific idea, but it was also way to understand what if it matters, what's true, what the world can change for us and how we can be protected. if it doesn't matter what's true we're in grave danger because we have the capability to not only destroy ourselves and our civilization but to take so many species with us."
