  "Text": ", I mean, I think it's up to the individual But for me, you know, I was so ridiculously fortunate in that I, tutorial in science because I'm not a scientist and I wasn't trained in science, was 20 years of days and nights with Carl Sagan. And the wonder, I think the reason Carl remains so beloved. Well, I think there are many reasons, but at the root of it is the fact that his skepticism was never at the cost of his wonder and his wonder was never at the cost of his skepticism. he couldn't fool himself into believing something he wanted to believe because it made him feel good. But on the other hand, he recognized that what science, what nature is is really, it's good enough, you know, it's way better than our fantasies. And so if you're that kind of person who loves, loves life and your eyes are wide open and you read everything you can get your hands on and you spend years studying what is known so far about the universe, then you have that capacity, really infinite capacity to be alive, but all and also at the same time to be very rigorous about what you're willing to believe Carl. I don't think he ever felt that his skepticism cost him anything because again, it comes back to love. He wanted to know what Nietzsche really was like, not to inflict his, you know, preconceived notions on what he wanted it to be. So you can't go wrong because it doesn't, you know, I mean, you know, I think the pale blue dot is the is, is a perfect example of this, his massive achievement is to say, ok, or the Voyager record is another example is here we have this mission, our first reconnaissance of the outer cellar system. Well, how can we make it a mission in which we absolutely squeeze every drop of consciousness and understanding from it. We don't have to be scientists and then be human beings. think that's the tragedy of western civilization is that, you know, it's one of its greatest gifts has been science and yet at the same time, that we are the Children of a disappointed father, a tyrant who puts us in a maximum security prison and calls it paradise who looks at us, who watches us every moment and hates us for being our human selves, you know, and then most of all, what is our great sin? It's partaking of the tree of knowledge, which is greatest gift is humans, this pattern, recognition, this ability, to see things and then synthesize them and jump to conclusions about them and test those conclusions. So I think the reason that in literature, in movies, scientist is a figure of alienation, figure, you know, oh, you see these biopics about scientists and yeah, he might have been great, you know, he was missing a ship. You know, he was a lousy husband, he lacked, you know, the kind of spiritual understanding that uh maybe, you know, his wife had and it's always in the end they come around. But to me that's, that's a false dichotomy that we are, know, to the extent that we are aware of our surroundings and understand them, which is what science makes it possible for us to do. We're even more alive."
