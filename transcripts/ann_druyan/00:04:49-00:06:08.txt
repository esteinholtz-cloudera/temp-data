  "Text": "touched on what I think is for me, that's how my way into science is that for me, it's much more spiritually uplifting revelations of science, the collective revelations of know, really countless generations of searchers and the little tiny bit we know about reality is the greatest joy for me because think it relates to the idea of love. Like what is love that it is based on illusion about the other. not love. Love is seeing unflinching other accepting with all your heart. And to me, knowing the universe as it is or the little bit that we're able to understand at this point the, is the purest kind of love. And therefore, you know, how can our philosophy, our religion, if it's rootless in nature, how can it really be true? I just don't understand. So I think you need science uh to get a sense of, of the real romance of life and the great experience of being awake in the cosmos."
