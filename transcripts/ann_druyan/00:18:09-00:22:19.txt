  "Text": ". I mean, really, you know, Voyager Voyager is doing this on energy than you have in your toaster, something like 11 watts. So, ok, but because of this gravitational assist, both Voyagers were destined, as I say to, they were, first of all, they were supposed to function for a dozen years and now it's 42 years since launch and we're still talking to them. that's amazing. prior to launch almost a year 89 months prior to launch, was decided that since Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and Linda Salzman Sagan had created something called the pioneer 10 plaque for the pioneer spacecraft that preceded Voyager which was kind of like a license plate for the planet Earth, you know, a man and a woman hands up, you know, very, very basic um but very effective and it captured the imagination of people all over the world. And so NASA to Frank and to Carl and said, we'd like you to do a message for Voyager because if it's going to be the milky way galaxy for 1 to 5 billion years, you know, it's like 20 trips around the galaxy a very small chance that a spacefaring civilization would be able to flag one of them down. so on board, you see this exquisite golden disk with scientific hieroglyphics explaining our address and various basic scientific concepts that we believe that would be common to any space varying civilization. And then beneath this exquisite golden disk uh the Voyager record. The golden Record. and it contains something like 100 and 18 photographs, images uh of life on Earth as well as pieces of music from all around the world. It's many people describe it as the invention of world music. World music was not a concept that existed before the Voyager record. And we were determined to take our music, not just from the dominant technical cultures, but from all of the rich cultural heritage of the earth. there's a sound essay which is a kind of uh using, a microphone as a camera to tell the story of the earth beginning with its geological sounds and moving into and then into technology. like, I think what you were getting at is that at the end of this sound essay, had asked Carl if it were in the making of the record, it was my honor to be the creative director of the project. If it was possible to, if I had meditated for an hour while I was hooked up so that, you know, every single signal that was coming from my brain, my body uh was recorded then converted into uh into sound for the record. Was it possible that these putative extraterrestrials of the distant future of perhaps a billion years from now be able to reconstitute this message and to understand it. And he just big smile, you know, and just said, well, hey, a billion years is a long time and go do it. And so I did this and what"
