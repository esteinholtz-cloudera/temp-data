  "Text": "have witnessed money be peripheral take, take, it has taken a back seat in the human rights conversation. The idea of currency, who makes the money, who makes the rules, who issues it, who sets the interest rates all these things? is not on the menu of human rights activists. If you just do like a systematic study of like the human rights discourse over the last several decades, money is not there. It's also not really taught in schools like Children don't really learn about money. Where does it come from? It's, it's kind of hidden from, from our, from a lot of our discourse. Um Only really when I got into Bitcoin, did I start learning more about money. Um I spent 10 years at the Human Rights Foundation we, we did all kinds of programs around the world. We convened Oslo Freedom Forums in different places and I got to meet hundreds of dissidents and very rarely did they ever speak about currency or bank accounts or moving money from one place to another. But when I started asking them, they always had amazing stories about money. Always. I mean, my friend Ivan Maire, who started this flag movement in Zimbabwe, which ended up toppling Robert Mugabe when I asked him to come to San Francisco to give a talk about hyperinflation which he lived through. said no one's ever asked me to do that before. But I'll come and he came, this was about three years ago. And the first thing he did when he got on the stage is he opened up a shirt and he brought out a necklace that had the 19 eighties Zimbabwean dollar on it. And he said, we in the activist community wear this as a symbol of where our country used to be because the Zimbabwean dollar used to be worth \u00a32. then of course, over the next 2.5 decades of economic mismanagement and corruption by Mugabe, it got inflated out of existence, right? You've seen those like $100 trillion Zimbabwean Notes. Um So he had to live through that, which was terrible and crushing. But he, you know, is an expert on money. If you actually talk to human rights activists about money, they know a lot about money. They're just not usually asked to talk about it., you know, for me, um money, you know, when I studied money or look at money. It's really about control, you know, who, who is creating it and how much does the population know about the creation of that money? And when it comes to Bitcoin, it's really the people's money. Like there is no shadowy force in charge of it. We all know the rules. We all know how it's going to get minted and how it's going to get printed, you know, that information is out there for everybody to see. And there's no like special group of rules for one group of people or another group, you know, a billionaire and a refugee are the same in the eyes of the protocol. This is a rather revolutionary concept and in the same way that democracy allowed us to decentralize politics and have checks and balances. And in the same way that the internet is a culmination of technologies that allowed us to decentralize information, access to and control over it., you know, decentralizes money. I mean, no longer again, is there one group of people who can just change it arbitrarily? We're all on the same playing field. And I think that is a tremendous innovation."
