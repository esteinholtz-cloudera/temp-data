  "Text": ", I agree with you in my mind. Sort of destruction and suffering are next door neighbors. So we don't need to destroy all of human civilization, if much a large fraction of it lives in conditions that we would equate to suffering. That that's not a good world. there advice that you would give to young people today about life about career about how they can help a world where 53% are, are living under authoritarian governments. But in general, a world that's full of injustice, but also full of opportunity."
