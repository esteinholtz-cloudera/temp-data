  "Text": "it's not just Bitcoin itself like exchanges today are adopting something called lightning network, which is a way to scale Bitcoin on a second layer. Much like we had gold bars which we scaled with paper money and then we had visa credit cards which were a way of scaling the paper notes. scales through lightning network. It's a private instant globally final settlement network. It's, it's something you all should check out. It's very, very interesting. exchanges aren't adopting lightning for its privacy benefits. Like lightning operates off the chain, meaning surveillance companies can't see they can't do chain analysis on lightning because it's on an onion routed second layer of that works kind of like the Tor Tor project. exchanges don't care about privacy. They're doing it because it reduces fees. Lightning is cheaper and faster. So again, we have this really interesting alignment of incentives where like the freedom tech is being promoted by people who don't, I don't, it doesn't matter what their incentives are, I could care less if they were altruistic or not. And I think this is, and you're going to maybe see this even in the future, there's more things coming in Bitcoin down the pike. Uh Lightning was enabled by an upgrade called sew, right, which took place a few years ago, which was the culmination of the block size conflict. another thing coming up called cross input signature aggregation, which may, if it, if it takes effect in the next few years, may compel exchanges to collaboratively spend all their Bitcoin together in a way that really protects our privacy and fights surveillance, but they're not going to do it for moral reasons. They're going to do it because it's going to save them money and improve their bottom line. Can"
