  "Text": "you meant of stuff that's already out there because I can give you examples that for, for example, the the kind of things that I would like to work on. But also the kind of things that I'm hoping to see, which is I could be used by centralized powers, by governments, by big organizations like Facebook and Twitter and so on collect data about people, right? But I believe there's a huge hunger among people have control over their own data. So instead you can have A I that's distributed or people have complete ownership of their little A I systems. So like the kind of stuff that I would like to build or like to see it to be built is you could think of it as personal assistance or A I that's owned by you you get to give it out, you have complete control over all of your data. You have complete control over everything that's uh learnable about your day to day experiences that could be useful in this, in the market of goods and ideas and all those kinds of things. So it has to do with. I know you talk about the surveillance, which is very interesting, it's who gets to have control of the data. And I think I believe there's a lot of hunger among regular people have control over their data. Such that if you want to create a business, you have a lot of money to be made from a capitalist perspective by providing products that let people control their data or you have no control."
