  "Text": "seen both in my work at A RF I started by helping to put together backpacks with foreign information that we sent to the Cuban Underground Library movement. in Cuba, you know, to own a book at the time, you had to have the government's permission, there was very little internet penetration. OK. So we would send in movies, you know, V for vendetta dubbed into Spanish. And people would sit inside their homes and they'd watch it and they would answer questions with each other and it was very powerful. then after that, I worked with people inside North Korea, we would send in flash drives, we have this program called flash drives for Freedom. We've sent over 100,000 flash drives in our work into North Korea. A country of about 25 million people. That's a lot. It's a big, big difference. That's, you know, many, many millions of hours of films, books, movies, et cetera. So I've seen the power that technology can have where, you know, in the sixties and seventies, you know, to get to break an information blockade, you had to like send in crates of books into a communist country. now all of a sudden you can send the entire contents of what was once the Library of Alexandria on something, the size of your thumbnail. That's remarkable. So obviously, I've seen the positives of technology. We will certainly get into Bitcoin, but I'm very concerned about essentially big data analysis, like what people call A I or general specific kinds of A I concerning. I think these are very authoritarian. I mean, it's very hard to make a case that A I is going to be good for human rights. Very difficult. In my opinion, it may be good for health, it may be good for our efforts to protect the planet. It may be good for a lot of scientific things. I find it very hard to believe it will be good for civil liberties. Oh,"
