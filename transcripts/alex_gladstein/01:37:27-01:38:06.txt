  "Text": "many people with too much money to be lost to go to a hot war on both sides. But eventually we're just gonna, someone's gonna have to stand up. I mean, the subjugation of Hong Kong and the genocide of the Uyghurs and the colonization of Tibet. I mean, Taiwan is the next big thing. I mean, Xi Jinping has made it very clear, you know, Xinzheng Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan. we're going to have to stand up for Taiwan for, for different reasons, both for moral reasons, but also for semiconductor reasons. We need TS MC to be on our side and not have China take over TS MC. So um there's different reasons why we're going to have to protect Taiwan. Um and you just hope it's not a hot war. I mean, at this point."
