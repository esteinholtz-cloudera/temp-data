  "Text": "with me on this journey as well. now a quick few seconds summary of the sponsors check them out in the description is the best way to support this podcast. First is stripe A payment platform. is paper space, a platform I use to train and deploy machine learning models. Third is Code Academy, a website where you can learn to code fourth is NI A company that helps engineers solve the world's toughest problems. And fifth is a sleep, a self cooling mattress cover I sleep on. So the choice is money A I programming engineering or sleep. wisely. My friends and the choices today are kind of amazing. now onto the full ad reads as always no ads in the middle. I try to make these interesting. But if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will too. show is brought to you by Stripe, an amazing payment platform that has helped thousands of companies of all sizes, make processing payments, simple and borderless. Stripe has engineered the world's most powerful and easy to use API S so you can get up and running in minutes, not days. They also have a new no code solution called payment links allows you to sell online by generating a link. You can share with your customers to get paid fast, all with no coding required. But if you're anything like me and you love coding, you can still work with Stripe to create some incredible systems, they make payments powerful and simple. If you like simple, you can go simple. If you like powerful, you can go with powerful, you can go with both. whether you're an online or in person retailer, software platform marketplace or subscriptions business. If I can only speak English visit stripe.com, that's stripe.com, I should start doing these ad reads in Russian. show is also brought to you by paper Space Gradient, which is a platform that lets you build train and deploy machine learning models of any size and complexity. I love how powerful and intuitive it is. I'm likely going to use paper space for a couple of machine learning experiments. I'm doing as part of an upcoming video dot A I which is a course I highly recommend it's run by Jeremy Howard, which is one of the most legit machine learning people and instructors and just humans and researchers out there. He uses it fast. A I uses it, you can host notebooks on there, you can swap out the compute instances any time. So you can start on a small scale GP U instance or even CPU instance and then swap out once your compute needs increase, you can start small then go big. really excited about what they're calling workflows which provides a way to automate ML pipelines. On top of grading computer infrastructure, it makes it really easy to build a production app because all the orchestration is reduced to a simple configuration. File a YAML file give gradient a try visit gradient dot run slash lex and use the sign up link there. You get 15 bucks in free credits which you can use to power your next machine learning application. That's gradient dot run slash lex. show is brought to you by Code Academy. The website I highly recommend you go to if you want to learn to code, it doesn't matter if you're totally new or somewhat experienced. There's a course there for you. I love Python. So I recommend you sign up and take their learn Python three course. They say it takes 25 hours to complete, but it is so clear and accessible and even fun that I think it will take a time than that. But if it takes that much time, it will just fly by time flies when you're having fun. It gives you the most important basics, which I think is what a great course does clear concrete basics, beautifully done, beautifully presented. It's great., get 15% off your Code Academy pro membership when you go to Code academy.com and use promo code Lex, that's promo code lex at Code academy.com to get 15% off Code Academy pro the best way to learn to code Code Academy spelled Codec ad Emy. It's not Code Academy, it's just Code academy.com promo code Lex. show is also brought to you by N I formerly known as National Instruments N I is a company that has been helping engineers solve the world's toughest challenges for 40 years. Their motto is my favorite motto of basically any company is engineer ambitiously. They have a podcast called Testing 123 where they uh talk about how different and innovators use testing to overcome failure to improve their products. They also have amazing articles and N i.com/perspectives covering engineers and engineering innovators. Again, going through this whole process of testing of challenging their systems until failure and through failure learning how to improve it. That is the uh journey of engineering. That is what I love about engineering. That is a feature, not a bug. Anyway, engineer ambitiously with N I at N i.com/perspectives, that's N i.com/perspectives. episode is also brought to you by eight sleep and their pod pro mattress. It controls temperature with an app is packed with sensors and can cool down to as low as 55 degrees on each side of the bed. Separately, there are very few things I look forward to in life as much as uh either taking a power nap or getting a full night's sleep and a cold mattress with a warm blanket a little bit of air conditioning in hot Texas summer, hot Texas fall. mean probably the power nap in the sleep itself is the biggest source of pleasure. But I think sleep when you can get, it something that's uh very important so might as well use the best tools for the job to get the best sleep. You can, have a pot pro cover so you can just add that to your mattress without having to buy theirs. But I have, their mattress is pretty nice. cover can track a bunch of metrics like heart rate variability, but cooling alone is honestly worth the money. Go to asleep.com/lex to get special savings. That's asleep.com/lex. a side note,"
