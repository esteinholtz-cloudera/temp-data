  "Text": "power, torture executions. We know these things are wrong. I mean, we know they're wrong. We don't have to read a book to know that. Um, you do, you do need to, people can get brainwashed. I mean, you talk to people who've grown up in North Korea that they don't know any better, like, they don't know what's going on in the outside world. So they've never experienced anything differently. So that's why, technology can play a big role here in terms of like the meaning of it all. Like it can really help emancipate liberate people at least so that they can make their own choices about what to do, at least so that we're on a level playing field. So technologies like the internet and Bitcoin, um they can at least like give you the option to do things your own way on your own terms and then, and then, and then from there, we'll see. Um you know, you know, I think it's important that we have design choices where we can like um a little more say and that not everything be preprogrammed for us that, that would be very disappointing. So, I mean, the open web and encryption and Bitcoin, these are things that help uh prevent social engineering and that promote more freedom and, and more possibilities, honestly, and more entrepreneurship and more creativity and more scientific inquiry. I mean, think about the people who tried to shut down scientific inquiry 506 100 years ago or whatever that we're trying to say. you know, the earth was the center of everything and they were wrong. You know, and then, you know, all these conservative religious types throughout history have always said that, um you know, there's no, no value in science and there's no value in technology and they've been wrong the whole time. So let's continue pushing here. Let's continue pushing."
