  "Text": "to define technology, data analysis and you know, maybe specific A I et cetera does, but encryption allows us to fight back. It's very important people understand we have tools to fight back. The, you know, Big Brother can only grow if it can feed on your data. If it can't get your data, it can't grow. So you have to willingly give up stuff to the cloud um for this monster to grow and we can, we can, we can like make the monster and shrink it if we give it less data. And I think that's where I would agree with you in terms of like wanting to empower people to be able to do stuff on their own terms in a sovereign way. And yeah, maybe you're, you're kind of thinking like the personal assistant who helps out Tony Stark or something like that. And, and that's yeah, as long as there's no back doors and that's a sovereign thing that you've popped up and created and you have the keys to absolutely. But practically speaking, we're talking about the world today, as is we need to be concerned about the way that authoritarian regimes are using big data analysis and they're going to buy this software and this equipment from the Chinese government, they're already doing it. Street level surveillance has already been purchased by governments from Latin America to Sub Saharan Africa to, to the heart of Europe. Um There's been huge scandals in Britain over their purchase of Chinese surveillance technology. Um part of the Chinese government's Belt and Road campaign which is basically to build the infrastructure of this century and to be in control of it is this part of that idea is to is to ship out and install surveillance technology um both at the telecom level and at the surveillance level across dozens of countries around the world and have that back door, right? national security law in China, which states that like companies that are Chinese, which are abroad are mandated to send data back to Beijing, right? So they are building this like huge global surveillance state. And again, not talked about enough. You should go Google and research the Belt and Road. I think it's very important that we confront this."
