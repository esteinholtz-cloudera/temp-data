  "Text": ". Yeah, there's like a ladder that you climb the election and you pull the ladder up and then no one else can climb up. This sadly happened in Egypt and it was quite predictable after Mubarak was ousted after the Arab Spring, know, Morsi came in and it, it looked like, you know, the Muslim brotherhood was not really going to be very democratic. Um, but it didn't really matter because then the military came back and now we have Sisi who's even worse than Mubarak. So, a lot of times in these regimes, unfortunately, it's very difficult for people to build that democratic society afterwards. Um people have told me that when you live in a totalitarian or an authoritarian regime, it's kind of like a political desert. What grows in the desert, scorpions and cacti, right? So basically people with very extreme views because you as an authoritarian ruler, your best method for control is to get rid of the moderates, you have to crush the moderates. That's very important. You want to have the only opposition to be extremists way. When you go and have negotiations with the United States, you can hold up the terrorists or whomever the extremists and say it's either US or them, right? And then the realists who run the US government are going to choose you. And that's why one of the reasons why the US government has supported so many dictators around the world over the last few decades."
