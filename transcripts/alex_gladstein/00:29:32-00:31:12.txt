  "Text": "started with authoritarianism or autocracy, right? Ruled by one or, or a small group oligarchy and all humans lived under this structure for, you know, the, the virtual, you know, bulk of all human existence. Only until pretty recently did we start having actual democracy? The idea that we should be ruled by rules, not by rulers, very powerful um invented in many places across the world. Uh Western Africa had this idea and so did the ancient Greeks and they started to implement it. Although as most know, we didn't have full democracy for a long, long time because it was only property owners, only men, only people of a certain race. this idea that that we can like rotate our rulers and that we could be ruled by rules is extremely powerful. And it really like for me, the ideas behind this, um I think unlocked a lot of the industrial revolution, the small personal freedoms that were allowed in some countries but not others. And they unlocked a lot of the scientific innovation over the last few 100 years. And to me, there's like a really straight line between like scientific inquiry, free speech freedoms and then more prosperity and more effectiveness as a civilization. So I, I think that democracy, you know, ruled by the people is definitely an upgrade from autocracy or oligarchy, you know, which would be ruled by, by one or, or ruled by a small group. And I think that the, the Democratic Revolution been an incredible thing for our world. And it's, it's, you know, you can do half glass full, half glass empty, half glass full is that almost half the world lives under democracy like that? That's an incredible achievement,"
