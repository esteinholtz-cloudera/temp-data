  "Text": ". So we talked about authoritarianism and we talked about the surveillance state. me, Bitcoin has two kind of key mechanisms through which it can help us. one, it's a sovereign savings account, it's debasement proof, meaning the government cannot print more whenever they want. is very, very different from fiat currency which by its very name, its very nature can be issued on sort of demand by the rulers. while I live in a country where the rulers do a reasonable job of managing the money, most people aren't so lucky. So only 13% of humans in the world live in a country that's a liberal democracy with property rights and has what we call a reserve currency, meaning a currency so stable and desirable that other countries save in it at the central bank level, right? You basically have the US, the UK, Australia, Switzerland, Euro and Canada. I mean, those are like reserve currencies and these are liberal democracies where people have reasonable guarantees over property rights. Everybody else either lives under like a weaker currency or an authoritarian regime. That's 87% of the world's population. Almost 7 billion people them. A sovereign savings account. That's permissionless. Meaning you don't have to have ID to use. It is a big, big deal. And a lot of people talk about Zimbabwe or Venezuela has some like isolated cases. Oh, we will, you know, hyperinflation only happens in, in those two countries. Um I actually did some research into this and there's about one point o over a, you know, close to 1.3 billion people who live under double or triple digit inflation. This is not an isolated instance. We're talking huge countries, Nigeria, 200 million people, 15% inflation, turkey inflation for 100 million people. Argentina, 40% inflation for a country of 45 million people. Um So you can go down the list. There's about 35 countries where like people's earnings, their wages um are literally disappearing in front of their eyes over a matter of weeks or months against things like the dollar gold real estate, right? So this is a huge issue. It absolutely is a human rights issue for me. I mean, when it comes to your time and energy having control over that or having it stolen from you. think this is pretty clear and Bitcoin is like an immediate uh low cost, easily accessible solution for people. And I've learned this not from my own assumptions, but by talking to people, by interviewing dozens of people whether it's in Sudan, which currently has triple digit inflation, um or uh people who've escaped from Syria who have used Bitcoin to get their wealth out of the country and then also to make payments back to people inside or Venezuela or elsewhere, it's very, very powerful."
