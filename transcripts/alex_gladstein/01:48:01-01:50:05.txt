It requires great design to come up with a way to, know, there's a parade of front here, there's a right way to hit that trade off. And I honestly think there's the UX, experience should be centralized, should be designed by the company. But the data and a lot of stuff that could be used to violate your basic rights should be owned by the individual. And I think there's a way to decouple those create an incredible experience to where go there and you enjoy the market where you can share your data and have complete control over it and always have, I mean, there's a lot of basic UX ideas just as an example, I think there should always be everything you design a one button that's always there that says, forget I ever existed, everything you know about me and maybe it's one button that you click and it asks, are you sure? And you have to be able to say yes, that's a feature that's fundamental to a good social network. I believe currently social networks. First of all, most of them don't allow you to do that. They don't make it transparent how much data they had, who they shared it with and they also make it exceptionally difficult to delete accounts. So that's a very basic starting point. But, that having that button means that you have control. But that's step one of the control, there's a transparency of knowing exactly when what data is being shared about you, how much data is already being recorded about you all that is transparency. And I believe in the, I believe that's a really good business model because when there's transparency and control people would be willing to give over a lot more data as long as they know what they're given over, as long as they know what they can delete."
