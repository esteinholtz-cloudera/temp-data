  "Text": "about the prison camps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. So from the human rights perspective, one of our programs is we, like, we try to after people who do like pr for dictators. So like, like a lot of people do like pr firms in Washington, get hired by all these dictators. Um And they make a lot of money to make them look good. It's called whitewashing or putting lipstick on a pig or whatever you want to do. Astroturfing is like the fake, make like fake social media accounts to make it seem like you're popular. But whitewashing is a huge issue. So, um I think it's completely fair to interview like dictators and stuff like that. Amanpour does a pretty good job. She's, she's really good. She, she, she, she makes sure that there's no messing around. I mean, her interviews of Musi recently the Ugandan dictator was very good. I mean, she's basically like, well, like, why are you rigging another election? Please tell us, you know, and she's fearless and she's good and that can be a helpful thing to have youtube as a resource. Um But it's, it's, it's quite clear when, when it descends into APR session and you just have to be like, very careful about it. Like Asma Al Assad, the wife of the butcher in Syria, you know, was like profiled by, by Vogue and it was this whole rose in the desert thing. A bunch of nonsense. Terrible, terrible, terrible, total propaganda. But a like honest interview where you are, you know, you're asking about all the tough questions, very important, you know. So I think, I think it's just a matter of like content is,"
