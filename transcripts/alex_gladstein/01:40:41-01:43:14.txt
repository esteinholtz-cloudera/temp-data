  "Text": "very concerned about social media platforms and companies. It almost feels like we're losing the golden age of the internet. You know, we could like go online and, and, and you know, interact with each other and share and not be worried about censorship. It feels like that that was a golden age, like in the late nineties, two thousands and now everything is, is becoming very politicized and I'm not sure that there's a solution like I don't think there's a button we can press to fix it. I'm kind of afraid that this is sort of just what happens when uh societies digitized. Like, like, I, I think that certain opinions just become demonized in, in, in the sort of, um, in, in the room, in the, in the social room that we have on the internet. And I don't know if there's a magical solution there. I do know that there's technological solutions that will allow us to continue to communicate and for creators to reach their audiences without censorship. Um And that's very exciting. Like right now you could be deplatformed from your you know, from like whether it's Patreon or youtube or whatever. Um And your, your bank account can be closed down, right? There are emerging ways that Adam Curry, like the pod father and a bunch of other people are experimenting with where you can essentially have your audio podcast across a whole bunch of different um you know, platforms. So, you know, it's censorship resistant then your audience can pay you over lightning in streaming money, like they can stream you money as they listen. So you're removing the whole advertising piece, you don't need to do advertising anymore. You have this direct relationship with um your uh you know, your audience and this is possible with something like lightning where you can do streaming money that's censorship resistant and a lot of the people who are building a lightning network. example, Elizabeth Stark, who, you know, started lightning labs and you know, has done in her within her company, the people that work, work with her have built a huge part of the lightning infrastructure. You know, what animates her is this idea of like uh again, artists and creators being able to have that direct um ability to reach out and have that peer to peer relationship with their, with their audience. And I, I'm excited for that and I do think that's coming, but I, I am very worried that the golden age of like, like centralized social media platforms is kind of behind us and I'm not sure how to fix that. I don't know if that's like a fixable problem."
