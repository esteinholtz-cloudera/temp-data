  "Text": "Tesla stacks Bitcoin, they're just doing that as self interest. They think it's going to be a good inflation, hedge fun. But what they maybe don't care about don't realize or they don't need to care. I mean, Bitcoin's power is it like co opt people promoting a freedom tool? Even if they don't care about it or even if they hate freedom doesn't matter. So when Tesla stacks Bitcoin and the price goes up and more interest goes up and more people around the world are like, wow, Bitcoin, more people get involved. Again, more adoption, more price, more developers, better user interface, more privacy tools. Um more mining, more network security. It's just this like positive feedback loop that continues to grow and it will it will grow intensely in the next decade as we go through the adoption cycle. And the reason why I'm so excited about this is the human rights world. Again, to get back to our previous conversation is very hard to find people who, who have, you know, the empathy the altruism to actually make a difference abroad in places like China or Saudi Arabia or North Korea. Um People are very quick to just like, they'll just quickly toss off the pretty words that they care about human rights as soon as profits come into play. So there's no alignment of incentives, right? The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful is that it aligns the incentives all of a sudden, they can be as greedy as they want. They are being forced to promote a freedom tool. This I've never seen before. And it makes me, it gives me a lot of like excitement. It's very refreshing we've been laboring in the human rights space and you have to like raise money and it's all like nonprofit work and you're like begging for people to make a difference for you. Here, you have this like incredible asset which people will accumulate out of self preservation, self interest and greed and yet it will strengthen the power of the individual. That is what we need to fight Big Brother. That's what we need to fight. Like what I'm scared is happening in China like this growing authoritarian state, which is powered by big data analysis. is our way to fight back and, and it runs on this like really interesting engine again that like takes advantage of our base nature as humans. And I know that it sounds terrible for me to say this. But I mean, ultimately, we are self interested and it is hard to, to get people to care about others living 1000 miles away. know, we are kind of localized in our empathy speaking as someone who works to help people who live in like 100 different countries, it's very difficult to get Americans to care about what's happening in Belarus or in Kashmir. It just is. But guess what, they're gonna definitely care about Bitcoin because they want to see their, their net worth go up, they want to do better for their family, et cetera. They're going to get into this thing and it's really gonna like make that powerful tool for everyone else who's using it. this interplay dynamic is fascinating to me."
