  "Text": ". So our chairman at, at the Human Rights Foundation was Vaslav Havel, who of course was like the famous Czech democracy activist uh who, you know, helped lead the Velvet Revolution. And then ended up becoming the first democratically elected leader of the Czech Republic after the Soviet Union fell. Um He passed away in 2011 and was very difficult to find a replacement uh because who can fill Havel's shoes, you know, but if one could, it would be Gary. Right. So we, like, really tried to get Gary to join and thankfully he agreed. And, uh, we've had an amazing relationship with Gary over the years. I mean, he's been relentless in his pursuit of freedom. I mean, he could have retired and taken his career in a different direction and he could be hanging out with Putin and have a pleasure yacht and all kinds of stuff, but he decided to risk it. if you actually study like the times when he was running for president in Russia, Masha Gessen followed him around in the man without a face. It's a great book about Putin. Um, there's a fabulous chapter where she's following around Gary when he's campaigning. And I mean, that he risked a lot. I mean, he can't go back to Russia anymore. He gave up his country. He's given up a huge amount to be able to speak his mind and to have this dream, this beautiful vision of a free and Democratic Russia. He really believes in it. been a great experience. I work very closely with Gary. Uh, we talk a lot, um, we do different things, uh, around the world together. He's, he's come out to a lot of events in different cities around the world. Um, and he's been a very active chairman. This isn't some figurehead, he's very involved and it's really, really great. I mean, everything he's involved with is uh you know, as one journalist who attends our event says when he walks in the room, you know, the average IQ of the room goes up pretty significantly. not, I'm not, I'm not a big chess person unfortunately. So I have not been able to connect with him on that, but I think he probably would prefer it that way. All he gets is people who want to talk to him about chess, you know, so here we can talk about kind of human rights strategy and how to, you know, improve our fight against dictators. But he really has that moral clarity that I, that I, that I really appreciate. So,"
