  "Text": ", I think that at the end of the day, like trade is actually really good. Um And you can just look at France and Germany as an example of, of how like a capitalist structure would develop. If you have two capitalist actors, they're very unlikely to fight each other. There's very unlikely to be violence, right? These are two countries which murdered some large percentage of each other's male population three times in 100 years, in three different wars, right? And now today war is like unthinkable and a lot of that is because of increased collaboration, increased trade. So when you have two capitalist actors, they act in a very productive way with each other. Um But as soon as you introduce an authoritarian actor, you know, all, all bets are off. So I think what you have is a conflict between capitalist actors and authoritarian actors. at the end of the day, people need to, yes, have more than just capitalist intentions in, in the geopolitical level. I'm talking about they need to actually take a stand for principles. Otherwise you have athletes and businesses and governments that are all too happy to, to do business with the Chinese Communist Party, for example, right now, I think that there is a little more than just kind of the pure um the pure profit.
