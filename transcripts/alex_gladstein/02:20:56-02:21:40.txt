  "Text": ". Yeah. Look, I'm a lot more concerned about what's happening right now. Like, like what is destroying ourselves if you were to go and see what's happening in Xinjiang or North Korea right now or Eritrea, is destroying ourselves and it's already happened. So, I guess the end, that's why I said that is, yes, I mean, if you don't decentralize and power is completely under one person, um, life is destroyed as we know it. And, and, you know, you don't have to go into science fiction to know what a totalitarian hellscape dystopia is. several that exist already and, you know, let's try to help those people at the same time as we're trying to push out into space would be my counter, I guess."
