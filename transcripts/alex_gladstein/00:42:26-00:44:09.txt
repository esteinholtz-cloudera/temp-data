  "Text": "society versus a F society. Society. People are, it's all about the tradeoffs you make in your daily life, like living more privately with more freedom is less convenient. You trade freedom, privacy for convenience and comfort and speed. Absolutely. It's an engineering decision in everything that you do. Um in the west we in advanced democracies, we have not personally seen the results of that trade off because we've, we live in these free societies that have these checks and balances and freedoms. But as soon as you step into an authoritarian state and you make those tradeoffs, your life, you know, immediately becomes more, more restrictive. And, and what people are worried about is that even in advanced uh economies, market, democracies, et cetera, the people are worried that they might not survive the, the, the great social digital transformation. You know, look at what the NSA is capable of doing. I mean, for now it's not that big of a problem because we still have free speech. Um But it's deeply concerning what Snowden revealed and it's a nice reminder that we need to be focused on, on privacy and encryption and on helping users become more, more sovereign regardless of where you live. It's kind of like a crutch to live in a free society. Like, you know, it's almost like a free lunch in a way. You're not going to be sent to a prison camp because of the color of your skin or your beliefs or what you say about the government. Um And you're very lucky. Uh Again, most people do live in a society where you, you can be persecuted for those things. And I feel like especially in America, we, we forget that we're, we're, we're distanced from that really strong reality, you know,"
