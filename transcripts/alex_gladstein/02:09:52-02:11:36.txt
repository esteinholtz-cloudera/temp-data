  "Text": "one's the best. I mean, she's just so fearless. Incredible. She interviews Putin in the, in the book at the end. It's really good. The third one is a fiction book, uh called The Mandibles, uh written by Lionel Shriver. one's good. It's a good gift book. It's funny. It's dark, it's witty, but it's about the United States losing its status as the reserve currency and going into hyperinflation. And what's interesting is that the characters in the book map where we are today. The book itself is about the late, I think it's the late 20 twenties and we have a populist president who decides to announce that the United States is like, basically going to default on its debts and the rest of the world comes up with like a new currency everybody switches to that one and the dollar like overnight becomes worthless. And all these like economists are saying, no, it's fine. Like inflation won't be a problem. And there's this one character who's an econ, who's like an economist. he, he's basically, he gets to the point where he's living as a refugee in prospect park in Brooklyn and he's still saying everything's fine, you know, so it's like it's dry, it's witty, but it's also about um the surveillance state. It's about centralization of power. It's really good. So the Mandibles, I would highly recommend so those three books and then on the topic of Bitcoin, because we talked about it a lot. I would just say that my portal into Bitcoin was the Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos. And I did it by audio book. And I just think this is an important one for people to start with because he goes through all the main concepts, whether it be proof of work you know how the network functions. But he does it in a way that's extremely engaging and really fascinating. And it really just kind of like sparked my curiosity"
