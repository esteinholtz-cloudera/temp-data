  "Text": ", yeah, the Exodus to Signal was in January. They had a huge user surge for two main reasons. One hilariously enough, of course, was Elon tweeted like you should use signal, right? Which is not insignificant. And then the other one was that like whatsapp changed kind of some of its terms of service and like, you know, announced to all of its users in this little pop up um that it was going to be sort of like changing the way it handled your data that spooked a lot of people. So these two things really combined. Um and tens of millions of people in the following weeks between January and February joined signal. It's like it really has had its day in the sun. And they are like, frantically trying to keep up with it, like, and it's really nice to see that uh that this encrypted messaging service, which, which prioritizes your privacy um in a way that, you know, you know, the government again may know like the metadata but doesn't know exactly what you're saying unless they can get your hands on your phone. think that's very, very powerful. So it can be done. I, I don't want to be too jaded here. I think it can be done. Um I, I think we can fight back and I think we can make continue to make the digital communications tools and platforms um in a way that, that, that really benefits us."
