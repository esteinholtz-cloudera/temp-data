  "Text": ". Everything is an engineering trade off. But yeah, you can trade off some of the assurances of the base layer to go into lightning for example. And, and there you can get more speed and more privacy and the things that Bitcoin lacks speed and privacy, for example, um you can get on the second layers. So there's, there's all kinds of cool engineering things that people are coming up with. Um But I also want to say who says the Blockchain, like that's a red flag for that person doesn't really know what they're talking about. Like Toshi didn't use the Blockchain in the, the, the white paper Blockchain was a marketing term that people came up with later to try and do this thing. That was kind of like it peaked in 2015 and, and it continues to be an issue today of it's Blockchain, not Bitcoin. that was like a very corporate um kind of social attack on Bitcoin to say we could take this like ledger part of this radical thing that's for criminals and all these bad people. But we could take one part of it out and we could bring it over here and we could make it safe for everybody. real mccoys, Bitcoin, I mean, Satoshi referred to it as a time chain. I mean, really what they're talking about is just these like blocks that are connected chronologically of transactions. It's really not that exciting. The exciting part of Bitcoin is, is the proof of work, you know, where the transaction processing is done by mining and by energy and by real world expenditures instead of like, you know, some central ledger. you know, when you remove the Blockchain from Bitcoin, it's not very, to me, it's just not, it's just not that interesting."
