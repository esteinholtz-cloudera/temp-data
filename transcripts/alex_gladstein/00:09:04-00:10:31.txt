  "Text": "rights are liberties and positive rights are entitlements. So after world war two, when the UN came together, it was largely a compromise between the Communist Soviet Union and the, you know, free United States, right? So the US had uh on its side of the UN Declaration of human Rights, uh a bunch of liberties, essentially, things like free speech, freedom of Association, freedom of Assembly. Soviets wanted entitlements like the right to work, the right to have housing, the right to water, the right to a vacation. So you actually read the UN Declaration for Human Rights. It's a negotiation between the Soviets and the Americans. Later, there was another document in the seventies released called the International Covenant on civil and political rights. And this is what HR F uses as its sort of like lodestar um founding document and this is like essentially an international agreement on the negative rights. Those are the things we choose to focus on because essentially authoritarian regimes can commit fraud and claim they're giving the positive rights the entitlements without having any of the negative liberties. And they can do that because they don't have any like free speech or press freedom. When you, when you take people's basic fundamental freedoms away, it's quite easy to make like a Potemkin village and pretend that there's the entitlements and that we have good health care. And you know, it's the same sort of thing that authoritarians have done for decades. Cuba and Venezuela and the Soviet Union. Do"
