  "Text": ", I think we can keep it simple for the purposes of this conversation. You have politics, information and money. Those are the three things I would encourage us to focus on in politics. Yes. Someone invented democracy. I mean, whether it was the Greeks, um, the West Africans or many others around the world, around the same time, invented this idea that we should be ruled by rules and not by rulers, right? Um And that has evolved dramatically, right? And now you and then you have information, information also used to be highly centralized, right? You know, think about how rich you had to be to gain access to a library before the printing press or you know much money you had to have or how close to the king or the, you know, feudal lord, you had to be to be able to have that ability. But now, you know, the majority of the world, billions of people have access to all information in their pocket and they can set up an account on social media and get their word out. not only politics but information has been dramatically decentralized. Um And I would say that encrypted messaging is kind of a corollary to that second innovation. And as much as now, people are like more effortlessly like signal is a lot easier to use than P GP. For example, they're more easily able to practice privacy when it comes to having private messages globally. Um These are all good things and we need to keep pushing. And I think money is like,, maybe the most important piece and that's why I spent so much time thinking about Bitcoin. OK. So"
