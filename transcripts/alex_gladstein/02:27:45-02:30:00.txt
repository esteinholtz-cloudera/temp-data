  "Text": ", I think first of all, 911 just shifted the world dynamics completely from a focus on big power politics between the US, Russia and China to this new threat of Islamic terror. Um a lot of it we learned later, a lot of the things we did were manufactured, choreographed like there were no WM DS in Iraq, like the reason our rulers said we needed to invade and destroy this country was a lie. Um And that, that I think is really been forgotten. Like I think a lot of like the Zoomers like today don't really know a lot about that time period. I mean, it was pretty crazy unanimously. I mean, democrat republican like Biden, Hillary Clinton, like, and the Republicans, everybody wanted to invade this country and it was very, it's very um a confusing time. There's a really good book by Ian mcewan called Saturday, a fiction book that takes place during, I think 2003. And it's one day in the life of the Doctor in London. really good though to revisit this time because he has two character. He has characters in the book, one of whom is very pro war and one of them is very against war. Basically, he, the father himself is pro war and his son is against it. And they have all these debates and it's nice to go back to revisit at that time was, it's really crazy and it really showed you that like, the media could be captured into, like, helping promote this idea of like invading another country. I was very curious about why we did it and like who, who was pulling the strings and why, what are the reasons that we went? And what's really interesting is that like, I took all these courses on and interviewed all these decision makers, whether they were like neocons or whatever, different people who were involved and the whole like, dollar reserve currency thing, like, really never came up until like, I, I learned about it more recently because of Bitcoin. Like, today, when I look back, it seems kind of obvious that the reason we invaded Iraq was because Saddam Hussein wanted to sell oil in Euros. It seems really obvious when you go back and look at the chronology of it. Um, and we were like, no, we actually don't want you to sell dollars in euros because that would threaten the dollar. So we're going to invade you and then you're not going to do it and then no one else is going to, like, sell dollars in Euro, you know, oil in Euros. Right? Um, I guess you could say the same thing about Gaddafi but, um,, we as a nation have very much protected our reserve currency. Let's put it that way. Yeah,"
