  "Text": "keep it simple. Um Let's look at one example, uh Twitter and Jack Dorsey and I think it's quite clear that what he believes is the solution is as you're kind of hinting at a more kind of like um regionalized uh system which is not have one or we call Federated system, right? Which does not just have like one company in charge of everything, there's an open protocol and then there's like different instances, right? So Twitter make, you know, Jack's dream for Twitter is that Twitter is this open protocol that the Russian government can use and the Chinese government can use and the Iranian government can use and the American government can use and then Twitter as a company is going to use two and you as the customer decide which implementation you want to join and there's going to be different censorship on each instance or each Federation. uh the protocol itself would be like untouchable. This is kind of like the idea behind the internet, right? There's like different parts of the internet that are censored, but like at the very bottom of the very bottom of the backbone of it, it's like this, this globally connected um relatively unstoppable thing, right? I think that's a pretty good vision and Twitter is working towards that with the blue blue sky like initiative. We'll see. I'm a little skeptical that it like works out because I've used, I use Mastodon, for example, Mastodon is an example of a um Federated social media. Now it's, it's ruled by a benevolent, instance is ruled by a benevolent dictator. It's just like I happen to like this one. So I know so rather than trust one dictator, Twitter, you could, you could, you could choose which dictator you want to trust and that's kind of the Federated model and maybe we head that way, but you lose things when it's Federated, you lose the UX, you lose the slickness and the and the feel and all the millions of dollars they spend on developers like Mastodon is like not anywhere close to as nice to use as Twitter. I feel like it again, it's this trade off that we make with everything where it's convenience, comfort, speed versus privacy and freedom, right? It's very hard to have something that gives you both."
