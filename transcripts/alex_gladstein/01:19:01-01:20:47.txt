  "Text": ", I and I'll give you two reasons. Number one, Bitcoin Blockchain is ultimately a settlement layer. It's kind of like something like wire in the United States. It's a way for like institutions to settle with each other. That's what I think it's going to be like in 2030 years from now, the average person is never going to touch the Bitcoin Blockchain. Probably they're going to use things like lightning or unfortunately, they may use Bitcoin banks, but they'll either use custodians or, or they'll use second layer non custodial solutions to interact. The main chain is going to get very expensive. It's going to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars or, or even more if the dollar starts to weaken to make a transaction on the main chain and that will be reserved for like very large transactions or transactions that need final, final settlement, et cetera, et cetera. Um I think that that's, that's fine and, and, and, and that's OK and it's very important that that ledger that settlement layer be kept by thousands of people around the world. The Bitcoin Blockchain is not centralized, it is, it is decentralized. It is run by people like me who run a node at home. I run a personal service. run the Bitcoin Blockchain. No one else you run it. That person runs it. There's no, there's no one in full. No. Yeah, I run a full node. It's great. I mean, it's pretty easy, man. You run it and that way you can be sovereign over all of your usage, right? And you can run it on a Raspberry Pi with less than 100 and 50 bucks of equipment. that's so important because again, there is no Amazon web service vulnerability here. That is a problem. And I agree with you, we're trending in a bad direction. We're like the government could just turn off, you know, a big important website or a news source. Well, they can't turn off Bitcoin because it doesn't live on Aws, it lives with us. We are Bitcoin and I think that that's, that's very, very powerful. Um And then you can"
