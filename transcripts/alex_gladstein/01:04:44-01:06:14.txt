  "Text": "? I mean, Bitcoin is the innovation, the innovation is in having the decentralized mint. No one can change the monetary policy. Everything else is downstream from there. Bitcoin, the meme would be 21 million. There's never going to be any more than 21 million. Every other Cryptocurrency either has an inflationary policy. I mean there's going to continue to be more and more of it over time or its monetary policy can be changed by a small group of people. This is vividly on display in Ethereum, which is like the second largest and second most robust Cryptocurrency. Right. I've talked to senior Ethereum engineers over the last couple of weeks trying to figure out what is the monetary policy of Ethereum. one can tell me no one knows how much e is going to be minted in 2022 and 2023 after they shift to proof of stake it, I've seen estimates that range from 100,000 to 2 million. at the end of the day, you're going to be trusting a small group of people to make those decisions. That is what we are escaping with Bitcoin. So all these other cryptocurrencies, they might have their use cases. Virtually, all of them are not. It's very important for people to know that if you take like the 4500 cryptocurrencies on coin market cap, almost all of them are scams straight up. Even the ones that have like noble intentions I just don't think are going to add that much value. Um Ultimately, I think Bitcoin to me is the innovation, and you know, that's because it has a monetary policy and an issue in schedule that cannot be changed. And that's what gets me so excited about it. I mean, that's why it's such an important tool for human rights."
