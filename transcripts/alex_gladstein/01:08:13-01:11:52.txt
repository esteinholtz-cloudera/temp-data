  "Text": ". So it's been interesting, it's been 12 years, more than 12 years since Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and they haven't been able to stop it. They have tried, tried a lot. I wrote a long essay for Quiet on this, like, like why haven't governments been able to stop Bitcoin? And my thesis is essentially that there's been like this mix of different kind of technical, social and economic and political incentives and disincentives that make it very difficult. Um And I think to me that the best way to think about it is that Bitcoin is like a Trojan horse. So just, just to actually that story just a little bit because I think it's important to understand the classical mythology tale. Um I find this very interesting of the, of the actual Trojan horse. Yeah, which was told in the aid actually by, by Virgil, right? And the idea was the Greeks had been like trying to take the city of Troy for like a decade at these like impregnable walls and they couldn't do it. And Ulysses and the rest of the Greek army were like, we don't know what to do., so Minerva, the, the, the God of strategy and war, you know, kind of like they get this idea from her, I guess to, to actually try to use subterfuge and trickery to take over the city. So the idea is, and this was sort of hatched by Ulysses, right? To put this horse together, that would kind of be like a gift. So the idea was the Greeks just like pretended to leave, right? They they deserted, left behind one soldier and this horse and the Trojans looked at it and they were like, what's going on here? And they brought in the soldier and the soldier is like, look, they left, they're so sorry for all of the desecration and blood spill. This is their gift to you. It's, you know, honoring Minerva. You know, it's like this like, you know, trophy for you guys. And there were actually people inside Troy, uh Cassandra as well as Lao Kwan who was like a priest who said, no, no, no. This is obviously a trick. This is obviously a trick. Um But they were like dispatched and ignored because the horse was like, it was just like so badass. So the the Trojans were like bringing it in the city. So they brought it in themselves. No blood spilled at all right in the middle of the night. Of course, we, what you realize is the horse was packed with Greek soldiers and they come out and they let the army in which was like hiding behind an island. So this idea that like could be so attractive that you really can't say no, even if you know what's inside of it is it played in Bitcoin. So like Bitcoin has this number go up technology, right? Is what we call it in, in sort of shorthand, NGO Ngu, right? But what people don't realize is that Ngu is like the Trojan horse inside the Trojan horse is fgu freedom go up technology. So dictators and rogue regimes and corporations are going to buy mine tax, accumulate this thing it's the best performing financial asset in the world. What they don't realize or they're going to have to ignore is that they're also aiding and abetting this freedom technology which allows individuals to be sovereign and eventually erodes their power. There's no question that rogue regimes and bad actors have already used and will continue to use Bitcoin. The thing is when you think about a North Korea or a Venezuela that government instructs some of its bureaucrats and cronies and officials to start stealing Bitcoin or accumulating it or whatever for short term gain to get around sanctions and, and use it to buy dollars or something like that, right? Which they can't get normally., guess what? All those people who the regime has instructed to like, figure this thing out and use it. They're all going to realize, oh my God, this is money. The government doesn't control and it's going to spread like a virus. Ok. So this is like the idea of the Trojan horse allegory. I think it's so important and powerful with Bitcoin. All the people talking about Bitcoin today on TV. They don't care about freedom or privacy, they just care about number go up. But what they don't realize is what's concealed within and that's very, very powerful to me."
