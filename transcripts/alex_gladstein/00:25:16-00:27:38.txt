  "Text": ", and look, there are tons of flaws with democracies. These are really good for the United States is a deeply flawed country in many ways. Our prison system is a disaster. Um There's, you know, a horrible war on drugs. We committed a grievous crime in my opinion by invading Iraq. Like we did a lot of problematic things. But our core architecture is still an open society. The people who criticize the US the most usually live within it. And if they were to move to a different country and try to use that criticism against their new rulers, they wouldn't fare so well. So whether it's Chomsky or whomever if they were to go to Cuba and live in Cuba and try to criticize Cuba like they do America, it wouldn't last very long. So I think what's important to distinguish between societies and closed ones or like like free societies and authoritarian regimes. It doesn't mean that your government is going to be good all the time. What it means is that the citizens have a way to push for reform, have a way to hold the rulers accountable. So even if you don't like what the US government does, whether it was under Biden or Trump or Obama or Bush, can rotate them through voting. And we have an independent Supreme Court that rotates over time and we have people that we can elect directly to serve our interests. And then there's like a free press and there's lobbyists and all kinds of people that jostle for power. So there's a separation of powers. And I like to think about a free society really as like at the bottom the, the foundation of the pyramid really would be free speech. And then you would have civil society, like, for example, um human rights organizations, environmental groups, stamp collectors, athletes, any groups that come together, you know, beyond the government's sort of strict instruction. And then on top of that and the third level, you have separate powers again what I'm describing. Um so authoritarian regimes don't really have any of these layers to them, right? And then at the top, then you put elections, but the elections are meaningless. If you don't have the foundation below, every dictator gets elected, Kim Jong Un gets elected. He's the only person on the ballot. Every dictator from Hitler to Chavez, they all got elected elections on their own mean literally nothing. You have to have these other layers beneath to actually be an open and free society. I think it's very important for people to understand."
