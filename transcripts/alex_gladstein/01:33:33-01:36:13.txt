  "Text": "blueprint? Is the fight against the South African Apartheid? So we did a few events down in Johannesburg. Um And I've had the pleasure of being able to go to the Apartheid Museum several times. Um And it really does a good job of chronicling how they were able to do it. It took a while. There's no doubt, but the way it was done was good, peaceful action from abroad was very important. So there was like the Sullivan principles. So like, um you can peacefully protest as a company, uh particular regimes. Um and it's very effective and not just corporations, but like the Olympics is a great example, like Chinese government should not be able to host the Olympics. The IOC should say no, not until you close down those. This is a perfect peaceful way to push back. No one gets hurt. Same thing when we had the Korean Olympics a few years ago, North Korea should not have been allowed any sort of symbol kind of hosting rights there. They have prison camps, gulags that we can see from outer space very clearly. And the regime is the cruelest one on the planet, probably. Why were they able to sit and cheer and, and you know, get to sort of cohos those at the Olympics. is spineless, like the, the IOC the Olympics and major corporations should stand up. Um especially in the cultural sector where you don't lose anything like, you know, or you shouldn't have to lose anything. So I think if we look at the way that we forced the apartheid regime, um out uh this international solidarity of musicians, athletes, performers, celebrities is very, very powerful. Unfortunately, today's celebrities are doing the opposite. We just, you know, have this press release go out yesterday about Akon he's, he's off whitewashing the crimes of the dictator of Uganda and trying to build a future city there with him. You know, if this was the 19 eighties, Akon would be raising his fist and saying we need to, you know, fight the apartheid regime. How do we get back to that? You know, we need to think about that. We have to figure out how to harness celebrities, influencers and companies and get them to actually stand up for something for once. I mean, that's something we've lost, we've really had a spine against that. And, and you know, we, we've lost it, you know, and, and you lose things. They, you lose them forever. Look at Tibet. Tibet was a big cause for people in the nineties used to go to colleges and kids would have the Tibetan flags all over the dorm rooms and it was like, ra radiohead would have Tibet on the stage and everybody wanted to, you know, free Tibet was a big thing. Guess what? Like, we lost it for some reason. It's not a thing anymore. And Tibet has been totally colonized, you know. So, I, I think it's important that we find a way to unlock, um, an interest, in the celebrity classes among athletes, singers, presidents, you know, we need to find a way to punish these people."
