  "Text": "have books. I'll briefly mention. Um Number one is the fear. The fear had a deep impact on me. The fear was written by Peter Godwin. It's about the systematic dismantling of Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe, Peter Zimbabwean. And it is a riveting book. I think everyone should read it because it helps you understand what it's like to go through. Not just authoritarianism, but also hyperinflation. And I mean, really, you know, at the end of the day, what the fear describes is how Mugabe took this country the 19 eighties. And he actually brought it back in time to the 19 twenties in terms of infrastructure, uh, literacy rates, health rates, all these things. He stole so much from the people and it's, it's a heartbreaking book, but it's a very important book. Um, and it's a, it's a way to do excellent, excellent journalism. So, The fear is a good one. Isn't"
