  "Text": "of people who are refugees, the number of people who suffer from natural disasters, the number of people who live under abject poverty, the number of people who don't have access to clean drinking water, all of these are dwarfed by the number of people who live under authoritarianism. yet it's not something that we talk about a lot because people are mercantilist and the powers that be are happy to sacrifice, freedoms and privacy for money. We live in a profit seeking world to get evidence of this. Take a look at the list of sponsors of the upcoming Olympics in in, in China where the CCP is currently committing genocide against the weaker population. look at the number of people and the famous investors who went to Saudi Arabia a couple of months ago for the Davos in the desert. I mean, Ray Dalia was there, all kinds of people were there and or at least they were invited and they said they were going to go and this is a government that uh at the time was torturing a female activist who just wanted to drive a car. This is a government that had murdered Jamal Khashoggi uh in a brutal fashion uh just a couple of years earlier. So I mean, at the end of the day when, it comes down to brass tacks, I mean, you know, the powers that be that even the free countries are led by people who are very, very happy to sacrifice all these pretty words about human rights when it comes down to profits, unfortunately."
