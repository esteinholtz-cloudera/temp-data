  "Text": "believe censorship is a really harsh word. I believe it's possible to create technologies where it's not Twitter doing the censorship, but it's individuals doing their own selection of what they want and don't want to see. So for example, if you get sick and tired of Donald Trump and whatever he says or you love Donald Trump, you get to select yourself, you get to have more control over what you consume. Twitter tries to do that a little bit but they obviously fail where ideas infiltrate our view that we, that misinformation spreads really fast and conspiracy theories spread really fast to where the immune system that Twitter has created to try to censor conspiracy theories and misinformation is firing and you're now censoring many people so that it's exactly the same intuition as you said before. If the state is doing it in this case, Twitter is kind of the state that's not going to work out well. But if you give power to the individuals to do this sort of the not even censorship but incentivization and de incentivization of great thoughtful content and terrible low effort content. Then I feel like that's going to create a system where there's going to be a much more open discourse of ideas, dangerous ideas, difficult ideas, controversial ideas and people in a decentralized way will be able to use their own intelligence to select content to share content, spread content."
