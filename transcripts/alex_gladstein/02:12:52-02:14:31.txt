  "Text": "two years ago, came together with seven other people from around the world. And we, we wrote a book in a book, Sprint. We lived in a house for four days. We wrote a book together. It was really cool. It was like a design sprint, but we did it in book format. And my co authors are from Nigeria Venezuela, the Philippines from, from former Soviet Union from all over. And it's called The Little Bitcoin Book and I'm still proud of it. It's 100 pages. It's something you give to somebody who knows nothing about the topic. it's not a technical book. It's about the sort of social, political uh aspect of it. Like, why is it important for you, for your finances, for your freedom, for, for your future? uh we've translated it into like a lot of languages by now. Uh I think English, Spanish and Portuguese are for sale and The Little Bitcoin book.com, you know, you go buy it. But we've made it as for, as a free PDF in Mandarin, Hindi, Punjab uh Korean U which I was really excited about Arabic FARSI and I mean, it spreads, man. It's been really, really cool. So I'm proud of that. I also made a video that did very well for Reason magazine called Why is Bitcoin protecting human rights around the world? It's five minutes and it just, I feel like I tried to boil everything that I, I want to tell you into this five minute video. So there's that um would recommend that. And then if, if you're interested in the, have governments not stopped it? Which I think is really intriguing. I wrote this long essay in Quiet in February called, you know, um why haven't governments banned Bitcoin? And um maybe that will be a helpful guide to some folks is speaking"
