  "Text": "thing we haven't talked about the violations of the human rights that authoritarian regimes do. There's not a positive, you mentioned that nationalism is a drug. There's something beautiful about loving your country, having pride in your country, loving the. a feeling of belonging, it could be country, it could be tribe, it could be family that's really powerful and that speaks to human nature as well. And that can sometimes overpower everything else. Patriotism. And sometimes it can be seen when you study history. When you look at Stalinist, the Soviet Union, or you can even look at Hitler and Nazi Germany. We tend to paint patriotism in a negative light. And then maybe when we look at the United States, but even here in the United States, people often paint patriotism in a bad light. You know, every time I say, I love America. So as an immigrant, I love this country, it's funny how that's taken as a political statement that, know, people, I guess on the right have been, have been more active in saying that they love the country and people on the left, uh have not of, it's almost become a weird slogan as opposed to a statement of just love. And I understand that patriotism can be a slippery slope into letting your government. I mean, it's exactly what you're saying. The value of freedom of speech is you hold your government to account for all the ways they mess up."
