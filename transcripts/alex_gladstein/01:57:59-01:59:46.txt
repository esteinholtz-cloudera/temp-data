  "Text": ", so he has a lot of fascinating ideas about artificial intelligence as well. He's open eyes a little bit to the, the state of Russia today because I've read most books on Putin in the English language in trying to understand things. And try to look at it from a historical perspective, like almost like we're living 100 years from now. And I look at Putin as a, as a important figure in the history of human civilization and study it in that way. think the way Gary looks at it, he probably doesn't appreciate me looking at the way I do, but the way he looks at it is can still change the direction of Russia and we individual human beings and we communities and we nations can take actions have policies that can change the direction of Russia. To me, I take a sort of go to the library passive view of studying fascinating aspects of Russia. To me, Russia means most of my family suffered through the Soviet Union and I see beauty and suffering, the poetry, the music, the stories, and just there's so much love that emerged from the pain that I just enjoyed the music of that. But to Gary and to many activists that I speak to, to them, love not just the Russia of the past, they have a vision and a hope for Russia of the future. And that and they criticize me a little bit for being a little bit too scholarly about the past and ignoring the future. And there's something to that. So he opens my eyes to look to the future"
