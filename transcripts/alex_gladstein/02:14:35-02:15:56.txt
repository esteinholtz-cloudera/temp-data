  "Text": "the end, it does get into that. But it really also just kind of goes through technically, why is it hard to do a 51% attack? Like why? Like if a government wanted to, could it really get all that equipment? a semiconductor shortage, like you can't like there, there's like certain things that stop governments from doing it, right? And same thing with like this idea of a 61 02 which would be um uh based on the idea of the executive order 6102, which is from 1933 when FDR made holding gold illegal in the United States. The idea is that like banks would go around now with governments and try to like, steal everybody's Bitcoin., in Bitcoin, we have like a practice um called Proof of Keys Day every January 3rd, you know, which is coinciding with the launch of the Bitcoin Blockchain where we all like withdraw our keys from exchanges and we'd be sovereign users. What we are doing is we are preparing for a 6102 attack which will one day probably come, right? the essay just goes through all of the like possible attacks and it runs through like the ones that happened like the Chinese and Indian governments, the two largest governments in the world, both tried to attack Bitcoin by banning their citizens from exchanging fiat for Bitcoin. It didn't work interest instead exploded. It's like the Barbra Streisand effect where in, when you know, by, by making something public and saying you shouldn't do X, it actually increases attention about X a lot more, right? So I think there's a lot of interesting game theory there that people would enjoy. Do"
