  "Text": "game. And so the approach that we used is self play. And so you have two agents that don't know anything, they battle each other, they discover something a little bit good now they both know it and they just get better and better and better without bound. And that's a really powerful idea, right. Uh that we then went from the one versus one version of the game and scaled up to five versus five, right? So you think about kind of like with basketball where you have this like team sport and you need to do all this coordinate. Um And we were able to push the same idea, the same self play uh to, to, to, to really get to the professional level at the full five versus five version of the game. uh and, and, and the things I think are really interesting here is that these agents in some ways, they're almost like an insect like intelligence, right? Where that, you know, there's, they have a lot in common with how an insect is trained, right? Insect kind of lives in this environment for a very long time or, you know, the the ancestors of this insect have been around for a long time and had a lot of experience that gets baked into, into, into this agent. And, you know, it's not really smart in the sense of a human, right? It's not able to go into learn calculus, but it's able to navigate its environment extremely well. It's able to handle unexpected things in the environment that's never seen before pretty well. Um And we see the same sort of thing with our dota bots, right? That they're able to in within this game, they're able to play against humans, which is something that never existed. In its evolutionary environment, totally different play styles from humans versus the bots. And yet it's able to handle it extremely well. And that's something I think very surprising to us was something that doesn't really emerge from what we've seen with PPO at smaller scale. Right. And the kind of scale we're running this stuff at was, uh you know, I could say 100,000 CPU cores running with like hundreds of GP US. Uh It was probably about uh you know, like, you know, so something like hundreds of, of years of experience going into this spot every single real day. so that scale is massive and we start to see very different kinds of behaviors out of the algorithms that we all know. And love"
