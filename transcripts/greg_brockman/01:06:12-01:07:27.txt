  "Text": ", to some extent, this, this question reminds me of, of a blog post from one of my former professors at Harvard, uh this guy Matt Matt Welsh, who was a systems professor. I remember sitting in his tenure talk, right? And uh you know that, that he had literally just gotten tenure, he went to Google for the summer. Uh And uh I then decided he wasn't gonna to academia, right? And that kind of in his blog post, he makes this point that look as a systems researcher that I come with these cool system ideas, right? And I kind of build a little proof of concept. And the best thing I could hope for is that the people at Google or Yahoo um which was around at the time will implement it and like actually make it work at scale, right? That's like the dream for me, right? I built the little thing and they turn the big thing that's actually working. And uh for him he said I'm done with that. I want to be the person who's, who's actually doing building and, and, and deploying. I think that there's a similar dichotomy here. Right. I think that there are people who really actually find value and I think it is a valuable thing to do to be the person who produces those ideas, right? Who builds the proof of concept? And yeah, you don't get to generate the coolest possible Gan images, but you invented the Gan, right? And so that there's, there's, there's a real trade off there. And I think that's a very personal choice, but I think there's value in both"
