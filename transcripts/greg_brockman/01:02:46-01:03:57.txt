So I, I think that, well, one thing that I think was really interesting about the reaction to that blog post was that a lot of people have read this as saying that compute is all that matters and that's a very threatening idea, right? And I don't think it's a true idea either,? It's very clear that we have algorithmic ideas that have been very important for making progress and to really build A G I. You want to push as far as you can on the computational scale and you want to push as far as you can on human human ingenuity. And so I think you need both. But I think the way that you phrase the question is actually very good, right? That it's really about what kind of ideas should we be striving for? And absolutely, if you can find a scalable idea, you pour more compute into, you, pour more data into it, it gets better. that's, that's the real holy grail. And so I think that uh the, the, the answer to, to the question I think is, is yes. Um that, that, that's really how we think about it. That part of why we're excited about the power of deep learning. The potential for building A G I is because we look at the systems that exist in the most successful A I systems and realize that you scale those up, they're gonna work better. And I think that that scalability is something that really gives us hope for being able to build transformative systems. So I'll"
