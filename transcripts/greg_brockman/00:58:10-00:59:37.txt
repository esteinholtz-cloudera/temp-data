  "Text": "think the turing test in its in its real form uh isn't just about language, right? It's really about reasoning too, right? That to really pass the turing test, I should be able to teach calculus to whoever's on the other side. And have it really understand calculus and be able to, you know, go and, and solve new calculus problems. so I think that to really solve the turing test, we need more than what we're seeing with language models. We need some way of plugging in reasoning. Now, how different will that be from what we already do? That's an open question, right? It might be that we need some sequence of totally radical new ideas or it might be that we just need to kind of shape our existing systems in a slightly different way. I think that in terms of how far language modeling will go, it's already gone way further than many people would have expected, right? I think that things like uh and I think there's a lot of really interesting angles to poke in terms of how much does G BT two understand physical world? Like, you know, you, you read a little bit about underwater uh in, in G BT two. So it's like, OK, maybe it doesn't quite understand what these things are. Um But at the same time, uh I think that you also see various things like smoke coming from flame and you know, a bunch of these things that G BT two, it has no body, it has no physical experience, it's just statically read data. Um And I, I think that I think that the answer is like we don't know yet. Um these questions though, we're starting to be able to actually ask them to physical systems uh that to real systems that exist. And that's very exciting."
