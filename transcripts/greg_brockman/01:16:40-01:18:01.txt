  "Text": "we really have a life cycle of project here. Uh So we start with a few people uh just working on a small scale idea and language is actually a very good example of this. That is really, you know, one person here who was pushing on language for a long time and then you get signs of life, right? And so this is like, let's say, uh you know, with, with the original G BT, had something that was interesting and we said, OK, it's time to scale this, right? It's time to put more people on it, put more computational resources behind it. And uh and then we just kind of keep pushing and keep pushing and the end state is something that looks like dota or robotics where you have a large team of, you know, 10 or 15 uh that are running things at very large scale. Uh And that you're able to really have material engineering. Uh and, and uh and, and, you know, sort of machine learning science coming together to make systems that work uh and get material results that just would have been impossible otherwise. So we do that whole life cycle. We've done it a number of times, uh, you know, typically end to end. It's probably 22 years or so, uh to do it. Uh, you know, the organization's been around for three years. So maybe we'll find that we also have longer life cycle projects. Um But, you know, we, we, uh uh we, we'll work up to those. have, Uh So, so 11 team that we were actually just starting. Ily and I are, are kicking off a new team called the reasoning team and that this is to really try to tackle how do you get neural networks to reason. And uh we think that this will be a long term project. It's one that we're very excited"
