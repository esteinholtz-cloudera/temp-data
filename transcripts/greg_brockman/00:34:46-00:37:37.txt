  "Text": ". That's right. And I think that there's there's some real truth here that the system that we set up the system for kind of how, you know, today's world is organized, um, is one that, really allows for huge impact. Um, and that, that, you know, kind of part of that is that you need to be that, that, you know, for, for profits are, are self-sustaining and able to, to kind of, you know, build on their own momentum. Um, I think that's a really powerful thing. It's something that it turns out that we haven't set the guard rails correctly causes problems. Right. Think about logging companies that go and deforest, uh, you know, the, the rain forest. That's really bad. We don't want that. Um, and it's actually really interesting to me that kind of this, this question of how do you get positive benefits out of a for profit company? It's actually very similar to how do you get positive benefits out of an A, um, right, that you have this like, very powerful system, it's more powerful than any human. And, uh, it's kind of autonomous in some ways, you know, it's super human in a lot of axes and somehow you have to set the guard rails to get good things to happen. But when you do the benefits are massive. And so I think that, that when, when I think about nonprofit versus for profit, think it's just not enough happens in nonprofits, they're very pure but it's just kind of, you know, it's just hard to do things there. Um, and for profits in some ways, like, too much happens. Um, but, um, if, if kind of shaped in the right way, it can actually be very positive. And so with open I LP, we're, we're picking a road in between. Now, the thing that I think is really important to recognize is that the way that we think about open I LP is that in the world where A G I actually happens, right? In a world where we are successful, we build the most transformative technology ever. amount of value we're going to create will be astronomical. so then in that case that the, that the the, the cap that we have will be a small fraction of the value we create. Um and the amount of value that that goes back to investors and employees looks pretty similar to what would happen in a, in a pretty successful start up. that's really the case that we're optimizing for, right, that we're thinking about in the success case, making sure that the value we create doesn't get locked up. And I expect that in other, you know, for profit companies that it's possible to do something like that. think it's not obvious how to do it, right? And I think that as a for profit company, you have a lot of fiduciary duty to your shareholders and that there are certain decisions that you just cannot make. Um in our structure, we've set it up so that we have a fiduciary duty to the charter that we always get to make the decision that is right for the charter um rather than even if it comes at the expense of our own stakeholders. uh and so I think that when I think about what's really important, it's not really about nonprofit versus for profit. It's really a question of if you build A G I and you, you kind of, you know, humanity is now in this new age benefits whose lives are better. Um And I think that what's really important is to have an answer. That is everyone."
