  "Text": ", right? But, and now imagine being in 1950 predicting Uber, right? And you need to describe the internet, you need to describe GPS, you need to describe the fact that everyone's going to have this phone in their pocket. so I think that that just the first truth is that it is hard to picture how a transformative technology will play out in the world. Um We've seen that before with technologies that are far less transformative than A G I will be. And so I think that, that, that one piece is that it's just even hard to imagine and to really put yourself in a world where you can predict what that, that positive vision would, would be like., you know, I think the second thing is that it is, I think it is always easier to support the negative side than the positive side. It's always easier to destroy than create. you know, less in a, in a, in a, in a physical sense and more just in a, in an intellectual sense, right? Because you know, I think that that with creating something, you need to just get a bunch of things, right? And to destroy, you just need to get one thing wrong. And so I think that that what that means is that I think a lot of people's thinking dead ends as soon as they see the negative story. being said, I actually actually have some hope, right? I think that, that the, that the positive vision is something that I think can be um is something that we can, we can talk about. And I think that just simply saying this fact of, yeah, like there's positive, there's negatives, everyone likes to dwell on the negative. People have to respond well to that message and say, huh, you're right. There's a part of this that we're not talking about not thinking about. that's actually something that's, that's, that's, I think really been a key part of how we think about A G I at open A I, right. You can kind of look at it as like, ok, like open A I talks about the fact that there are risks and yet they're trying to build this system. Like how do you square those, those two facts?"
