  "Text": "already had the conversation with Ilia, right? And everyone here. Uh And so you want as many perspectives and uh uh piece of wisdom as you can for, for answering this question. So I don't think you necessarily defer to whatever your powerful system tells you. Um But you use it as one input uh to try to figure out what to do., and I, I guess fundamentally what it really comes down to is if you built something really powerful and you think about, think about, for example, the creation of uh of shortly after the creation of nuclear weapons, right? The most important question in the world was, what's the world order going to be like, how do we set ourselves up in a place where we're going to be able to survive as a species a gi I think the question is slightly different, right? That there is a question of how do we make sure that we don't get the negative effects? But there's also the positive side, right? You imagine that, you know, like, like what will A G I be like, like what will be capable of? And I think that that one of the core reasons that an A G I can be powerful and transformative is actually due to uh technological development, right, if you have something that, as capable as a human and that it's much more scalable uh that you absolutely want that thing to go read the whole scientific literature and think about how to create cures for all the diseases, right? You want it to think about how to go and build uh technologies to help us create material abundance and to out societal problems that we have trouble with like how we're supposed to clean up the environment. And, you know, maybe you want this uh to go and invent a bunch of little robots that will go out and uh be biodegradable and uh turn ocean debris into har harmless uh molecules. And um I think that that positive side is something that I think people miss sometimes when thinking about what an A G I will be like. Um And so I think that if you have a system that's capable of all of that, you absolutely want its advice about how do I make sure that we're using your uh your capabilities in a positive way for humanity?"
