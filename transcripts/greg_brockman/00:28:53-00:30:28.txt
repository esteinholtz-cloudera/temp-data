  "Text": "thi this was actually a really core question for us uh for the past couple of years because, you know, I'd say that like the way that our history went was that for the first year we were getting off the ground, right? We had this high level picture. Uh but we didn't know exactly how we wanted to accomplish it. uh really two years ago is when we first started realizing, in order to build A G I, we're just going to need to raise way more money than we can as a nonprofit. Um And, you know, we're talking many billions of dollars. And so first question is, how are you supposed to do that and stay true to this mission? And we looked at every legal structure out there and concluded, none of them were quite right for what we wanted to do. And I guess it shouldn't be too surprising if you're gonna do some like crazy unprecedented technology that you're gonna have to come up with some crazy unprecedented structure to do it in. And uh a lot of a lot of our conversation was uh with people at open A I, right, the people who really joined because they believe so much in this mission and thinking about how do we actually raise the resources to do it also stay true to, to what we stand for. And the place you got to start is to really align on, what is it that we stand for? Right. What are those values? What's really important to us? And so I'd say that we spent about a year really uh compiling the opening Eye Charter and that determines, and if you even look at the first, the first line item in there, it says that look, we expect we're gonna have to marshal huge amounts of resources, but we're going to make sure that we minimize conflicts of interest with the mission. And that kind of aligning on all of those pieces was the most important step towards figuring out how do we structure a company that can actually raise the resources to do what we need to do? I"
