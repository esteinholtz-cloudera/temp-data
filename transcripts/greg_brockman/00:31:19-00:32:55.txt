  "Text": ". And I think this was the core tension as we were designing. Opening eye LP. And really the opening eye strategy is how do you make sure that both you have a shot at being a primary actor, which really requires building an organization, raising massive resources really having the will to go and execute on some really, really hard vision, right? You need to really sign up for a long period to go and take on a lot of pain and a lot of risk. Um and to do that, normally you just import the start up mindset, right? And that you think about, OK, like how do we out execute everyone? You, you have this very competitive angle, but you also have the second angle of saying that well, the true mission isn't for open A I to build a G I. The true mission is for a G I to go well for humanity. so how do you take all of those first actions and make sure you don't close the door on outcomes that would actually be positive in fulfilled mission. so I think it's a very delicate balance, right? And I think that going 100% 1 direction or the other is clearly not the correct answer. And so I think that even in terms of just how we talk about open A I and think about it, there's just like, like one thing that's always in the back of my mind is to make sure that we're not just saying open A I's goal is to build a G I, right. That it's actually much broader than that. Right. That first of all, you know, it's not just A G I, it's safe A G I, that's very important. But secondly, our goal isn't to be the ones to build it. Our goal is to make sure it goes well for the world. And so I think that figuring out how do you balance all of those um and to, to get people to really come to the table and compile the, the like a single document that that encompasses all of that wasn't trivial.
