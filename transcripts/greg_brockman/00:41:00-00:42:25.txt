  "Text": "? Assuming you can actually do the technical side of A G I development? I think there's going to be two key problems with figuring out how do you actually deploy it? Make it go well. The first one of these is the run up to building the first A G I. you look at how self driving cars are being developed and it's a competitive race. And the thing that always happens in a competitive race is that you have huge amounts of pressure to get rid of safety. so that's one thing we're very concerned about, right is that people, multiple teams figuring out we can actually get there. But you know, if we took the slower path that is more guaranteed to be safe, we will lose. And so we're gonna take the fast path. so the more that we can both ourselves be in a position where we don't generate that competitive race where we say if the race is being run and that, you know, someone else is, is further ahead than we are. We're not going to try to, to leapfrog, we're going to actually work with them. Right. We will help them succeed. As long as what they're trying to do is to fulfill our mission. we're good. We don't have to build a G I ourselves. Um, And I think that's a really important commitment from us, but it can't just be unilateral, right? I think it's really important that other players who are serious about building A G I make similar commitments, right? And I think that uh that, you know, again, to the extent that everyone believes that A G I should be something to benefit everyone, then it actually really shouldn't matter which company builds it and we should all be concerned about the case where we just race so hard to get there that something goes wrong."
