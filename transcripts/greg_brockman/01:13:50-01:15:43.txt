  "Text": ", so one thing that is interesting is that, you know, we lose all the time we play. So the dota team at open the eye, we, we played the bot against better players than our system all the time or at least we, we, we used to, right, like, you know, the, the, the first time we lost publicly was, we went up on stage at the international and we played against some of the best teams in the world. Um, and we ended up losing both games, but gave them a run for their money. Right. The both games were kind of 30 minutes, 25 minutes and they went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And so I think that really shows that we're at the professional level. Um, and that kind of looking at those games, we think that the coin could have gone a different direction and we could have, could have had some wins and that, that was actually very encouraging for us. Um, and, you know, it's interesting because the international was at a fixed time, right? So we, we knew exactly what day we were going to be playing and we pushed as far as we could as fast as we could. weeks later, we had a bot that had an 80% win rate versus the one that played at T I. Um, so the March of Progress, uh, you know, you should think of it as a snapshot rather than as an end state. Um And so, in fact, we'll, we'll be announcing our, uh, our, our finals, uh, pretty soon. I actually think that, uh, we'll announce our final match, uh, prior to, uh, this podcast being released. So, uh, there should be, uh, we'll be playing, we'll be playing, uh against the the world champions. And, you know, for us, it's really less about like that, the way that we think about what, what's upcoming the final milestone, the final competitive milestone for the project, right? That our goal in all of this isn't really about beating humans at dota. Our goal is to push the state of the art in reinforcement learning. And we've done that right? And we've actually learned a lot from our system and that we have uh you know, I think a lot of exciting next steps that we want to take. And so, you know, kind of the final showcase of what we built, we're going to do this match. Um But for us, it's not really the success or failure um to see, you know, do, do, do, do we have the coin flip go in our direction or against?"
