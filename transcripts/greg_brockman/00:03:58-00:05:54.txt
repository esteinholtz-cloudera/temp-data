  "Text": ", I think this is actually a really interesting perspective uh to take and to think about that you sort of have this collective intelligence of all of society. The economy itself is the superhuman machine optimizing something, right? And it's almost in some ways a company has a will of its own right, that you have all these individuals who are all pursuing their own individual goals and thinking really hard and thinking about the right things to do. But somehow the company does something that is this emergent thing. Uh And that is, is, it's, it's a really useful abstraction. And so I think that in some ways, you know, we think of ourselves as the most intelligent things on the planet and the most powerful things on the planet, there are things that are bigger than us that are these systems that we all contribute to. Um And so I think actually, you know, it's a, it's interesting to think about uh if you've read Isaac Asimov's Foundation, right? That uh that there's this concept of psycho history in there, uh which is effectively this, that if you have trillions or quadrillions of, of beings, then maybe you could actually predict what that being that, that huge macro being will do uh and uh almost independent of what the individuals want. I actually have a se a second angle on this, I think is interesting which is thinking about uh technological determinism. One thing that, that I actually think a lot about with, with open A I, right is that we're kind of coming on onto this insanely transformational technology of, of general intelligence, right? That will happen at some point. And there's a question of how can you take actions that will actually steer it to go better rather than worse? that I think one question you need to ask is as a scientist, as an inventor, as a creator. What impact can you have in general? Right? You look at things like the telephone invented by two people on the same day, like what does that mean? Like what does that mean about the shape of innovation? And I think that what's going on is everyone's building on the shoulders of the same giants. And so you can kind of, you can't really hope to create something no one else ever would, you know, if Einstein wasn't born, someone else would have come up with relativity, know, you changed the timeline a bit, right? That maybe it would have taken another 20 years, but it wouldn't be that fundamentally, humanity would never discover these, these fundamental truths."
