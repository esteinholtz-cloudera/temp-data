  "Text": "? lot of it actually boils down to iteration speed, right? That I think that a lot of what really motivates me is, is building things, right? Is the uh you know, think about mathematics, for example, where you think really hard about a problem, you understand it, you write down in this very obscure form they call proof. But then this is in Humanity Library, right? It's there forever. This is some truth that we've discovered, you know, maybe only five people in your field will ever read it. Uh But somehow you've kind of moved humanity forward. so I actually used to really think that I was going to be a mathematician. And uh then I actually started writing this chemistry textbook. One of my friends told me you'll never publish it because you don't have a phd. So instead I, I decided to build a website and try to promote my ideas that way. And then I discovered programming and uh I, you know that in programming, you think hard about a problem, you understand it, you write down in a very obscure form that we call a program. then once again, it's in Humanity Library, right? And anyone could get the benefit from it and the scalability is massive. And so I think that the thing that really appeals to me about the digital world is that you can have this, this, this insane leverage, right? A single individual with an idea is able to affect the entire planet. Um And that's something I think is really hard to do if you're moving around physical atoms."
