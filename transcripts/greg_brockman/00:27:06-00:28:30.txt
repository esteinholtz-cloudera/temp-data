  "Text": "I the whole entity and opening I LP as a vehicle uh is trying to accomplish the mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits everyone. And the main way that we're trying to do that is by actually trying to build General intelligence to ourselves and make sure the benefits are distributed to the world. That's the primary way we're also fine if someone else does this,? It doesn't have to be us if someone else is going to build an A G I and make sure that the benefits don't get locked up in one company or, you know, 111 with one set of people. Um like, we're actually fine with that. And so those ideas are baked into our charter, which is kind of the, the, the foundational document that are, that describes kind of our values and, and how, how we operate. Um it's also really baked into the structure of open I LP. And so the way that we set up open A I LP is that the case where we succeed, right? If we actually build what we're trying to build, investors are able to get a return. Um And, but that return is something that is capped. And so if you think of A G I, in terms of the, the value that you could really create, you're talking about the most transformative technology ever created, it's gonna create orders of magnitude more value than any existing company and that all of that value will be owned by the world, like legally titled to the nonprofit to fulfill that mission. And so that's, that's the structure."
