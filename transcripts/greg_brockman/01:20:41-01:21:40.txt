  "Text": "feel there's two separate questions, right? So, you know, kind of kind of at the core there of like, can we can we use simulation for self driving cars? Um take a look at our robotic system, Dactyl, right? That was trained in simulation using the Dota system, in fact, and it transfers to a physical robot. I think everyone looks at our Dota system, they're like, OK, it's just a game. How are you ever going to escape to the real world? And the answer is, well, we did it with the physical robot that no one could program. And so I think the answer is simulation goes a lot further than you think. Um if you apply the right techniques to it. Now there's a question of, you know, are the beings in that simulation gonna, gonna wake up and, and have consciousness? Um I think that one seems a lot, a lot harder to, to again, reason about, I think that, you know, you really should think about like, where, where exactly does human consciousness come from and our own self awareness? And you know, is it just that like once you have like a complicated enough neural net, do you have to worry about the, the agents feeling pain? And uh you know, I think there's like interesting speculation to, to do there. But uh but, you know, again, I think it's, it's a little bit hard to know for sure."
