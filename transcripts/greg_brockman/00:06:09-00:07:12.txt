  "Text": "right. That's right. And, you know, this kind of seems to play out in a bunch of different ways uh that there's some exponential that is being written and that the exponential itself, which one it is changes, think about Moore's Law, an entire industry set, it's cocked to it for 50 years. Like how can that be right? How is that possible? And yet somehow it happened. so I think you can't hope to ever invent something that no one else will, maybe you can change the timeline a little bit. But if you really want to make a difference, I think that the thing that you really have to do, the only real degree of freedom you have is to set the initial conditions under which a technology is born. so you think about the internet, right, that there are lots of other competitors trying to build similar things and the internet one and that the initial conditions where that was created by this group that really valued people, being able to be uh you know, anyone being able to plug in this very academic mindset of, of being open and connected. Um And I think that the internet for the next 40 years really played out that way. Um You know, maybe today uh things are starting to, to shift in a, in a different direction. But I think that those initial conditions were really important to determine the next 40 years worth of, of progress."
