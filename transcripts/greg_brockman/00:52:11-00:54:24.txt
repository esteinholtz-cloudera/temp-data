  "Text": "think it's a losing battle ultimately, right? I think that that is that in terms of, of the content, in terms of the actions that you can take, I mean, think about how captures have gone, right? The captures used to be a very nice simple used to have this image. of our OCR is terrible. You put a couple of, of artifacts in it. You know, humans are gonna be able to tell what, what, what it is an A I system wouldn't be able to today like I could barely do captures. And I think that, that, that this is just kind of where we're going. I think captures were, were a moment in time thing. And as A I systems become more powerful that there being human capabilities that could be measured in a very easy, automated way uh that the A I will not be capable of. I think that's just like it's just an increasingly hard technical battle, it's not that all hope is lost, right? And you think about uh how do we already authenticate ourselves, right? That, you know, we have systems, we have social security numbers if you're in the US or, you know, you have, you have uh uh you know, ways of identifying individual people. Um and having real world identity tied to, to digital identity seems like a step uh towards, you know, authenticating the source of content rather than the itself. Um Now there are problems with that. How can you have privacy and anonymity in a world where the only content you can really trust is or the only way you can trust content is by looking at where it comes from. Um And so I think that building out good reputation networks uh may be, may be one possible solution. But yeah, I think that this, this question is, is not an obvious one. I think that we, you know, maybe sooner than we think we'll be in a world where, you know, today, I often will read a tweet and be like, hm. Do I feel like a real human wrote this or, you know, do I feel like this is like genuine? I feel like I can kind of judge the content a little bit. Um And I think in the future, it just won't be the case you look at, for example, the FCC comments on net neutrality, uh it came out later that millions of those were auto generated and that the researchers were able to do various statistical tech techniques to do that. What do you do in a world where statistical techniques don't exist? It's just impossible to tell the difference between humans and A is. And in fact, the uh the, the, the most persuasive arguments are written by, by A I all that stuff. It's not sci-fi anymore. You look at GP T two making a great argument for why recycling is bad for the world. You gotta read that and be like, huh, you're right. We are addressing different symptoms."
