  "Text": "I think that, that this actually blends into our third team, right, which is the policy team. And this is the one the the aspect I think people really talk about way less than they should, right? Because imagine that we build super powerful systems, that we've managed to figure out all the mechanisms for these things to do whatever the operator wants. most important question becomes, who's the operator? What do they want? And how is that going to affect everyone else? Right. And, and I think that this question of what is good, what are those values? I mean, I think you, you don't even have to go to those, those those very grand existential places to start to realize how hard this problem is. You just look at different countries and cultures across the world and that there's, there's a very different conception of how the world works and you know, what, what, what kinds of, of ways that society wants to operate. so I think that, that the, that the really core question is, is, is, is actually very concrete. Um and I think it's not a question that we have ready answers to, right? Is how do you have a world where all the different countries that we have? United States, China, Russia. you know, the the the the hundreds of other countries out there are able to continue to not just operate in the way that, that they, that they see fit but in, in a, the, the, the world that emerges um in these where, where you have these very powerful systems uh operating humans, ends up being something that empowers humans more that makes like exi human existence, be a more meaningful thing and uh that people are happier and wealthier and uh able to live more fulfilling lives. It's not an obvious thing for how to design that world once you have that very powerful system."
