  "Text": "this is, I think this is actually a really interesting question. This comes back to the, how do you even picture a world with some new technology? And I think that that one thing that I think is important is, is, you know, let's say honesty. Um And I think that if you have, you know, almost in the turing test style uh sense sense of, of, of technology, you have a i to be humans and deceiving you. Uh I think that is, you know, that that feels like a bad thing, right? I think that it's really important that we feel like we're in control of our environment, right? That we understand who we're interacting with and if it's an A I or a human, um that, that, that's not something that we're being deceived about. But I think that the flip side of can I have as meaningful of an interaction with an A I as I can with a human? Well, I actually think here you can turn to sci fi. Um And her, I think is a great example of asking this very question, right? And one thing I really love about her is it really starts out almost by asking how meaningful are human virtual relationships, right? And uh and then you have a human who has a relationship with an A I and uh that you really start to be drawn into that, right? And that all of your emotional buttons get triggered in the same way as if there was a real human that was on the other side of that phone. so I think that, that this is one way of thinking about it is that I think that we can have meaningful interactions and that if there's a funny joke, sometimes it doesn't really matter if it was written by a human or an A I, what you don't want in a way where I think we should really draw hard lines is deception. Um And I think that as long as we're in a world where you know, why do, why do we build A I systems at all? Right, the reason we want to build them is to enhance human lives, to make humans be able to do more things, to have human humans feel more fulfilled. And if we can build A I systems that do that, uh you know, sign me up."
