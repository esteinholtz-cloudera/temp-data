  "Text": ". That's what it is. And they are surprisingly aware where they are as a generation. So it's a sense of pride as we are different from the older generation, from your parents who compromised and lived with the restrictions that the Islamic regime put on you. Your grand, the grandparents was the generation that actually involved in the revolution of 79. parents which were the middle generation. And these are the third generation after the revolution of 1979. And therefore they differentiate themselves in terms of their identity from the older generation. So that's the life part of it and we can go more and more they want to access and they see on social media what happens in the rest of the world. They're well aware, they're much better digitally skilled my generation for instance. Uh And, and they know about all the personalities, they know about all the celebrities, they know about all the trends that goes out outside Iran. So that, that's a second part of this message. And then of course, the third part is the word Al Zadi meaning freedom or liberty, which is this long standing demand of the, I would say for the whole century ever since the constitutional revolution of 1906, Iran has witnessed this problem of uh authorities that usually emerged at the end of a revolution uh to basically impose its own image on the population on the youth and create uh authoritarian regimes of which over the course of time, would say that the Islamic Republic is the worst in the sense that it's uh it's intrusion and it is not only in the political sense in the, for instance, banning the freedom of speech, you know, meddling with the elections, uh banning political parties, all kinds of bad things which are the political or civil freedoms, but it's intrusion into the personal life of the individual, is the worst kind in a sense as you would see that there is always that authority that basically uh dominates their life or monitors their life. So I I, and they do it in a kind of a very consistent fashion which makes this idea of freedom so important as part of the message of this new movement. You would see that uh in today's Iran, there are no independent political parties, there is very little probably freedom of the press. I wouldn't say that it's entirely gone, but it's fairly limited. There's enormous amount of propaganda machine which dominates the entire uh uh radio and TV system in Iran. It's completely in the hands of the government. of course, you would see this variety of other tools for trying to indoctrinate Iranian population across the board. So that's another sign of this kind of a sense of uh sense of being totally left out, you're not belonging to, to what's going on in terms of p power empowerment and disempowerment. So that's, that's the situation as far as the idea of a freedom is concept. And this three somewhat miraculously and perhaps unintentionally, three parts of this message uh compliments each each other because perhaps for the first time, we see that women are in the forefront of a of a movement. I hesitate to say revolution because I'm not particularly happy with revolutions, revolutions worldwide. And in Iran have always been so miserable in terms of their outcome that we have to be careful not to use the word the revolution. Yeah. that's where, where it stands now. And the regime was thinking that well, these are kids, uh they're going to go away and then of course, they're completely conspiratorial in their thinking. constantly think that these are all the uh instigations and provocations of foreign powers. These are the great Satan, the United States. This is Israel or these are the actually the supreme leader said in so many words, his only response so far that he had the past past six weeks with regard to these demonstrations is that these are the Children of the Sabak. Sabak being the security forces of the Shah time. That's 43 years later, claims that the Children 7, 1617 years, 20 years old kids in the street are the grandchildren or Children of some imaginary survival of the short security force. So"
