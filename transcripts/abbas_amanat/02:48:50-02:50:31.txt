  "Text": "tend to agree with you I have all the respect for the fact that would like to create security and happiness for its own people. there are two arguments. One is a moral argument to my mind. As a historian, uh Jews across around the world for all through their history suffered. this is a history of suffering, the history of memory of suffering. And I find it enormously difficult to believe that a nation that the product of so much sacrifice, suffering, loss of life, and variety of holocaust above all find itself in a position not to give the proper justice to a people who could be their neighbors. that is a moral argument which I cannot believe under any circumstances can be accepted. Second, in real terms. do you want to, you want to commit a genocide? you have a population there you have to come? To terms with it and you cannot just postpone as they did since 67. They're postponing and hoping that it goes away somehow. don't think it's going to go away, and it's going to get worse rather than better."
