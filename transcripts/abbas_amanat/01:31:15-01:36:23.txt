  "Text": "too precisely. And you know, you can name them from the beginning of the century with people like, I don't know Lenin or Stalin, of course, Hitler, even Mao, of course, you can name them. And probably as I would say is the last of them is Khomeini in that century that you would see this strong man a sense of uh even uh uh uh uh artificial or real or uh a sense of a so called charisma. with this total power over the regime that they create uh in the some of them do Nasser, he didn't have much of an oil resources in Egypt, but he was also one of these strong men. OK, in the 20th century, loved by some hated by others. Uh So it necessarily does not tie up to to uh resource, economic resources underground. But in the Iranian case, unfortunately, it did. it was a uh it was more than, it created more than one issue for Iran. It's created a strong state, which is the Pahlavi state from 1921 onward because in 1921 at the end of the first World War, Iran was in a almost a state of total bankruptcy. uh the British had a desire to try to bring Iran to the system that they created in the Middle East in the post war era, the mandate system, Palestine Iraq. And then of course, French mandate of Lebanon and Syria, all of this and Iran was separate because Iran was an independent country. It wasn't part of the Ottoman Empire that collapsed. they had to somehow handle it. And what they tried to do didn't work a result, partly domestic, partly international issues, wrote about a regime which is headed by the founder of the Palla dynasty, Reza Shah. OK. The first a military officer called Reza Khan, actually a military officer of the Kozak forces the Cossack forces was the force that was created in the 19th century model of the Russian cossacks when the ruler in the 19th century, visited Russia as in a royal tour. And the desire showed the great Kossack forces that I like this. And he created one for himself with Russian officers actually. So the Russian officers served in Iran from Iran eighties up to the revolution of 1917, the collapse of the regime, so many revolutions, so many revolutions and Reza Shah was an officer in that Reza Khan was an officer in that force and he created a new monarchy for reasons that we need not to go to. And it called the pale regime. P le regime was a modernizing regime.. That brought a comp that in effect fulfilled many of the ambitions of the constitution. Many of the aspirations of the constitutional revolution, better communication be uh secular education, um centralized state c uh centralized army, better uh contact with the outside world, greater urbanization. That's what a modern state is all about. in that regard, in a sense for the 1st 20 years after the Second World War was successful. Uh despite and more significant of all, it managed to keep the European powers which was always interfering in the local affairs of Iran in an arm length. So they were there in an arm length but they were also re respecting the power of the state part of the A PAV state during the Second World War. The same phenomenon earlier interference led to the occupation of Iran by the allied forces. The British from the South, the Russians from the north, the Red Army, they took over Iran. And of course, they said during world War Yes, from 1941 up to 1945. And of course, when the, the Red Army refused to withdraw from Iranian Azerbaijan. Um and with some of possible annexation of that province, there was a big issue in the post war Iran."
