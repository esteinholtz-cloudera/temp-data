  "Text": "this kind of a world was perhaps even 10 years ago, unimaginable that you see now a great power China, that it's going to remain from what we see around us as a great power Russia uh adventurous, foolish, but nevertheless would remain criminal. I would say as far as the its behavior in Ukraine. But actually, it's a rogue nation that it attracts another rogue nation. So Iran finds itself now in a greater place, place of security, in alliance with Russia in the hope that this would give Iran a greater security in this part of the world. this is whether this is a realistic or illusion, think remains to be seen. I think Iran China relation makes more sense. Although if you ask ordinary Iranians, they don't like it. would tell why should we be tied up with uh with China as the only uh uh trade party with, with America because of the foolish isolations that you have created for us, because of all the sanctions that you have created for us, the Islamic Republic. in a sense, it's a very difficult question to answer probably Iranians also like to be more on the other camp. But what happens is that in the real term, surprises me most is not this alliance with China, but it's kind of becoming lacky or subservient Putin's regime in Russia. if you look at it, since at least the 19th century, not going further back. The beginning of the 19th century, always viewed Russia as the greatest threat uh strategically because it was sitting right at the top of Iran was it was infinitely more powerful than Iran has ever been. Iran's for two rounds of war at the beginning of the century lost the entire Caucasus to Russia and learned its lesson. you have to be mindful of Russia you have to keep it as an arms arm's length. And that's what was the Iran's policies throughout the course of the 20th century, 19th and 20th century up to what we see now around us, which is a very strange situation. Um whether the balance has changed terms of the, if Russia is purchasing weapons from, Iran, which was unheard of, means that there is a new balance is emerging, a new relationship is emerging, perhaps remains to be seen. But uh you look at the historical precedence, it would have been enormously unwise to be an ally of Russia, given its long history of aggression in Iraq. See Russians of the reason why it's actually Iran allied itself with British Empire was the fact that it was so much afraid of the Russian expansion. as such, I don't know what's going to be the future of this relationship."
