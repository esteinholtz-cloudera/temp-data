It's obvious that this is what the future is about. So it's great that companies like inside tracker are doing this kind of thing.

He's probably my favorite guest and both of them I associate with on it, in particular, I associated with extreme level of high mental performance. No. Well, actually, yes, in a, in a very non-standard definition of what high levels of performance is. He's just an incredible human being kind brilliant thoughts that are sometimes filled with humor, nonsecular humor, also deep, profound insights of the like I haven't heard from anybody else. He must be using alpha brain. Well, I don't know that, but for me, I use alpha brain when I need a really focus when I know it's going to be a deep work session where I have to solve a particularly challenging problem.

I use them to protect my privacy on the internet. I'm actually having a great conversation with somebody about tour coming up and Tor is like an extra layer of protecting your privacy when you're browsing the internet. But for most of us, we should be using the sort of the low hanging food, the technology that works for everybody for everything, not just browsing, a VPN and my favorite VPN. And the ones I've used for many, many, many years is express VPN. Big sexy button you press and it just works. You set the location that you want your computer to emulate and uh and the connection is super fast, plus it's stable. Everything is very intuitive works on any operating system, including my favorite one which is Linux, but obviously on mobile devices too, iphone, all the Android devices. I have so many android devices now that I feel like I'm like a sheep herder and those are my sheep, instead of being sheep, they're actually supercomputers. Although you can argue that a sheep too is a supercomputer. Anyway, go to express vpn.com/likes pod for an extra three months free. is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it.
