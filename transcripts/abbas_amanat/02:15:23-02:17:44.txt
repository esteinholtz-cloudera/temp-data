  "Text": "sense of his savior. Yeah, who would, would bring you out of the misery that you are in and, and always looking for a for a third party solve your issues? That's why probably this movement has a significance because it's probably doesn't look for a Messiah. Although I was talking to my brother who is a historian also and he was saying perhaps the Messiah of this movement is that Massiah mini, the 22 year old girl that was killed, a martyred Messiah who is now leading a movement which no longer has that uh leadership with it. But uh yes, I would say that Iran has been the birthplace, if I might say that of Messianic aspirations, going back to ancient Zoras is which is the really the whole system that you see in major religions, or at least we so called Western religions. It's abrahamic religions parallel or perhaps influenced by Zoras is in which there is an idea of uh this word and the other word, there is a hereafter, there is an idea of a judgment at the end of the time. there is a concept that there is a moment of justice that is going to come with the rise of a religious or a charismatic fear. So it's a very old phenomenon in Iran, very old and its time and again repeated itself in the course of its history, but never as powerfully it happened in 1979 and never in the form of authority from within the religious establishment. It was always the dissent movements that were of antinomian and they were against the authority of the uh uh religious establishment that changed in the 20th century."
