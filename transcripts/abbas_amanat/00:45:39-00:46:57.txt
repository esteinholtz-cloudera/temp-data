  "Text": ", the answer to your lovely question which I think I hope it would have happened to me is that yes, you would see different cultures but different food, most important, different accents or different languages they have dialects. This balu is a different language altogether. But or so for that matter, Kurdish, which is closer to Persian because they are all in the European languages. but Turkish, a very Turkish, which is probably closer to the Turkish of Turkey, uh Republic of Turkey or to the Republic of Azerbaijan in the north because they, they are the same basically, actually, if you would have looked as a fascinating picture, if you have looked at the, let's say, even 19th century, early 20th century linguistic map of Iran, you would have been amazed the number of dialects in the number of languages that have survived. This is an ancient country, it is an ancient land and it's a lot of mountains all around it or big deserts. So there's a sense of isolation. So you would say here and there you see a different community that speaks differently,"
