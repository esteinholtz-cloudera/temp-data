  "Text": ", probably more than, more than I feel. Sometimes when I compare myself to what they are doing, it is 1979 the earlier years for a decade or two, tried in a very crude fashion to restrict access to media outside Iran. And because this is all through dishes, ok. And satellite dishes are everywhere. You know, if you look at the, uh, you know, uh, buildings, you know, small h, small towns and villages in Iran, there's always a dish and they watch all kinds of things through this particularly because of what's happening. Now, they listen to all the news, um, uh, broadcasts from all this media and they're extremely active. There are probably some of them, even 24 hours or close, very extensive coverage of every clip that comes through. So what the government is doing now, the Islamic Republic that they restrict the entire internet. They shut down the internet, they shut the internet, but they cannot afford shutting that internet because much of the business, much of the everyday life. Much of the government affairs depends on the internet, like everywhere else.

You, you order food to come to your house, which Iranians, at least the middle classes, the more prosperous middle class is doing all the time. So they deliver everything and because of the COVID, it became even more and they have to pay all through this system. So what happens is that now they're estimating that every day, $50 million the Iranian government or the Iranian economy is losing because of slowing the internet. Plus the frustration"
