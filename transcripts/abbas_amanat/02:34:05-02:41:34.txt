  "Text": "argue that for a long time even under the shaw but much more expressively and under the Islamic Republic, there was a determination to have a nuclear power or nuclear weapon in a sense. I think the bottom line of all the negotiations, everything else is that Iran of the Islamic Republic had the tendency of having its own nuclear weapon. reason for that is that Iran was subject of nearly nine years, 8.5 years of uh Iran Iraq war when uh not only Iran faced uh an aggressor Iraq that actually attacked Iran at a very critical time at the very beginning of the Iranian revolution. the fact that Iran felt kind of a helpless uh in the course of this war and has to make great sacrifices actually, which supported the Islamic regime and consolidated the Islamic regime because of this war. And most of the time the support of the United States was behind vis A vis Iran and Iran felt that it's been and has to protect itself. So there is some argument for having a nuclear capabilities. in reality, this has resulted in a completely mindless crazy, wasteful attempt on the side of the Iranian regime to try to develop a nuclear power. And therefore the rest of the world, particularly in this region were very worried that if Iran would get access to a nuclear weapon, then the entire region of the Persian Gulf particularly Saudi Arabia, possibly Turkey, possibly Egypt, all of them may require may, may demand to have also nuclear weapon. Given the fact that Pakistan and India has already have it. there was a determined attempt, as you might know, on the side of the western communities or now gradually both communities to try to as much as possible to control Iran from getting access to a nuclear capability or actually limit Iran's nuclear capabilities to what was defined usually in a euphemism as a peaceful fashion. OK. That being said there was also Israel viewed the Islamic Republic as a arch enemy some of it might be due to the Israelis own exaggeration of Iran's threat. And some of it is because Iran has developed a fairly strong military as we see today. as such, this attempt to try to prevent Iran from ever getting access to a nuclear weapon, which resulted as you might know in this massive that were imposed upon Iran since the beginning of the revolution in 1979. And of course more intensively since 2015, 2016. Even prior to that, probably a little bit earlier, uh this agreement, the nuclear agreement was supposed to control or monitor Iranian nuclear industry or nuclear uh setup exchange for removing the sanctions. this never worked. In a matter of fact, in a very successful satisfactory way for the Iranians or for the Americans, particularly under Trump administration, which I think foolishly to scrap agreement that was reached under President Obama, like many other policies that was implemented under the Trump administration. This created a major problem that is hard to under Biden, how to try to come up with a new nuclear agreement with Iran in this process since 2016 the United States withdrew from the agreement. Iran felt comfortable to try to go and do whatever they want without any kind of monitor being monitored by the international community. that's the situation. Now, we don't know whether Iran is really sincere under the present regime negotiate a deal. We don't know that the United States is willing to do so. uh it seems that now what is happening in terms of the protests in the Iranian streets makes it even harder a public eye to try to negotiate a deal with Iran because that means in the minds of many with some justification that uh the nuclear agreement would result in the removal of many of these sanctions, millions billions as the result of the removal of the sanctions and Iran's ability to sell its oil in the international market without any restrictions that the Iranian government is going to become even more powerful, more financially secure in order to suppress its own people. So that's the agreement that goes against coming to terms with uh with uh Iran. But the problem is that there is no clear alternative, even I'm not particularly personally favorable this agreement to be uh uh to, to be ratified. But the alternative is very difficult, there's no way to try to see what can be done"
