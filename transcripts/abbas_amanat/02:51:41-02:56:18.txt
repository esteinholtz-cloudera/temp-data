  "Text": "the other side, on the other side. Of course, I tend to agree with you fully. And unfortunately, this is a very critical situation that uh this region is facing Iran in particular. would say that um hope that in the minds of the people of Israel, is a enough or common sense to realize that escalation on the Israeli side is not in the favor of anybody try to let the Iranians to go on with their uh empty rhetoric as they do so far. But at the same time, I cannot deny the fact that, know, there is a danger on the side of this regime and what it says, it cannot be denied, nobody can justify that. particularly because the Iranian population is not behind this regime. Certainly in the case of the Palestinians or for that matter, it's not Palestine, it's the, the, the Islamic Republic's involvement in Lebanon with Hezbollah. It's the Islamic Republic's involvement in Syria with Bashar Al Assad, its involvement in other parts of the world, perhaps even Yemen, all of them creates extraterritorial responsibilities or interventions, unnecessary interventions ultimately is not in favor of interests of the Iranian people or Iran as a country, Iran has never been involved in this kind of politics before of the Islamic Republic. So in a sense, the Iranian regime, it seems to me by going to the extreme, try to create for itself space it did not have or did not deserve to have within the politics of the region is a uh so in other words, that has become part of the tool is kind of an instrument for if you like to call it some kind of an expansion is of the regime uh in parts of the world where it can see there is the possibility for its presence for its expansion. Uh Of course, historically speaking, Iran ever since 15th century, I think that's the earliest example I can see modern, in early modern times has always a tendency of moving in the direction of not only what is today, the state of Iraq, but further into the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. So that's a long term ambition that has been in the cards as far as as a strategic unities concern. But by no means justified and by no means could be a reasonable, could be a sane policy of a nation state as today's Iran. the second point is that also regimes are always victims of their own rhetoric. it's uh once you keep repeating something, you become more and more committed to it it cannot remain anymore in the level of a rhetoric, you have to do something about it. So there's some compelling pressure to try to uh uh to uh to materialize what you've been saying in your rhetoric and that is even extremely more dangerous. As far as Iran is concerned it brings it to some unholy alliances today we are witnessing Iran is getting involved even more dangerous than this rhetoric uh uh in, in terms of the vis a vis Israel is its involvement with Russia and to some extent with China, we can't talk"
