  "Text": "protests are now in their sixth week, death of that young woman, a Kurd who was visiting Tehran as a tourist sparked something very deep. that's particularly concerned the younger generations. That is what you would call the equivalent of the generation in this country. They call themselves the ha has to d in Persian because Iran follows the solar calendar of its own as an ancient solar calendar. And this the, the, the time that they were born, they were in the 13 eighties, that's what they call themselves hashtag eighties hashtag for the eighties. uh the uh well, the circumstances that surrounds the uh uh unfortunate death of this young, beautiful uh Kurdish woman uh is uh really tragic. She was arrested by the what is referred to as the morality police, morality patrol called Yash SD Guidance Police. That is there were two women fully clad that its officers serving on that force and two men nobody exactly knows what had happened. She had been beaten up and apparently there was no uh uh uh sign of any wrongdoing on her side. She was fully covered. It seems that uh uh there was some altercation in the process. uh the the outcome was that she was unconscious, uh not necessarily when she was arrested, but in the course of the detention, when they take them to a center, presumably to reeducate them and she apparently collapsed. And maybe my sense is that she must have had some kind of a problem because of the skull being broken or something had happened. she died in the hospital the next day. that's through the social media widely spread throughout. And almost the next day, surprisingly, you could see this outburst of sympathy for her. People are in the streets weeping she was seen as such an innocent young woman, 22 years old the family, the mother and the father also mourning for her and being a Kurd visiting Tehran, um this all added up to really turn her into some kind of a martyr of this cause. that's what it is. And her uh picture uh uh graphics that were artistically produced based on her portrait has now dominates basically as the symbol of this protest movement. And the protest movement goes on. Everybody was thinking or at least the authorities were thinking that is going to die out in a matter of a few days. it became more uh intense first in the streets of Tehran by young women, mostly probably between I would say 1718 teenagers to 2223 or thereabouts and then to university campuses all around the country and then even to high schools. And that also made it a very remarkable protest movement because first of all, it involves the youth not necessarily the older generations, you see them around but not as many., you see men and women together, young uh girls and boys. uh um they are adamant, they are desperate in the sense of the tone of their protest and they are extremely courageous because they stand against the uh security forces that were immediately were sent off to the streets. So and in full gear. That is"
