  "Text": "Iran? I'm not cynical. Yes, I'm trying to be realistic and I actually may be critical, but I have great hopes in uh Iran's future for a variety of reasons. I actually did write an article only if the last version of it is going to go out today in which the title of it is the Time of Fear and Women of Hope, in a sense is this whole coverage. But what this movement means that we see today, Pin may fizzle a few weeks time or it may just go on and created new in Iranian society that would hopefully result a peaceful process of greater accommodation and the greater tolerance within the Iranian society and with the outside world, I think the majority of the Iranian people don't want attention, want confrontation, want crisis., if 40 years, they have suffered from a regime that has dictated an ideology that it's regressive impractical. They want to go back to a life in which they don't, don't really create trouble for their neighbors or for the world. therefore I would see a better future for Iran. That's for one reason, strategically or geopolitically, maybe in Iran's in a peaceful fashion to negotiate as it's the fate of all the nations rather than commit itself or sworn to a particular uh course of uh policy. So this give and take as the nature of politics is art of possible as it's been said. probably Iran is going to be hopefully moving that direction. I think there is a generation. I think that's the third reason, matter how much Islamic Republic tried Islamize Iranian society in its own image of kind of radical ideological indoctrination. It has failed, has failed up to do we see today in the Iranian streets the Iranian population said no to it. And I think if there would have been, and I very much hope there will be a possibility for a more open environment, more open space where they would be able to speak their views out. are not on the side of moving in the extreme directions. are in the sight of greater accommodation and a greater interest in the outside world. if you look at every aspect of two days, besides the government, every aspect of life in today's Iran, we can see that from the way that people dress the way that they try to live their lives, the way that they're educating themselves or being educated in the institutions. you see a desire, an intention to move forward? And I'm optimistic."
