  "Text": ", well, you can see that uh birth rate was very high otherwise you wouldn't have doubled your population in matter of four decades. But Iranians because of the urban shift to an urban population because of the growth of the middle class, because of the education, basically the pattern of the uh of of growth, population growth changed. Iran used to be or 3%. Uh birth rate in around 19 eighties, I would say 19 seventies, 19 eighties. Now it is 1.1 and it's what probably the most successful country in the Middle East in terms of the population culture, despite the government, consistent uh attempt to try to people to have more kids. class refuses to do that. And this is middle class, not only anymore in the capital, but this is the very smaller towns and cities, places that used to be villages. Now you look at them, they have a decent population, 50,000, 100,000 and they live a urban life and they don't want to be to that old pattern of agrarian society when you had 10 Children or eight Children. And of course, it's a much more advanced in terms of uh in terms of uh health and medicine. So you don't lose, lose Children as they used to the anti. There's always of uh kids to survive. And therefore if you have 10 kids, you're sick with 10 kids, you don't end up with four as it used to be. In the past six of them would have died in the, in the after the age of five actually. But now because of that, you see that this urban population in the cities have completely different demands. of course, the education is important. That's another area of how the social engineering of the Islamic Republic went away because they were thinking that you know, the growth of the population, the growth of the educated, higher educated middle classes in their benefit or they could not even control it in a sense. Now, Iran, in my time uh probably had the 19 seventies, probably by the time of the revolution at 1012 universities. it has 56 universities all across the country. there is something referred to as the free university or that, which has campuses all over the country. It has 320 campuses all around Iran. does that mean many respects, This youth were brought up in these families, even in small towns, in very traditional families, in families that belong to that kind of a more religious, loyal to the clergy or to the clerical classes, Children now move on which particularly women because in, in my times, it would have been unheard of that. You would have a young woman of 18 or 1718, 19 from a traditional city such as for instance, Yazd or in, in, in, in uh uh southeastern Iran to move on elsewhere for education as you do in this country. Ok. Now it's completely accepted that a woman is her job? Because he's forced to wear her job to go to a university completely on the other side of the country. this movement of the population, not only because of the universities, but in general, if you now visit Iran, hear accents, local accents, I mean provincial accents all over the country. That is a Azerbaijani Turkish accent from the north west of the country. You can hear it in the first province, in the south and vice versa. So and Kurdish for instance, or even more marginal regions such as Sistan Province in the southeast of Iraq, which has been the subject of this recent massacre when they actually attacked the population when demonstrating and killed a fair number of at least 60 people. uh this movement of the population, uh this creation of a larger middle class, the better educated, middle class, much better educated Iran has 86% literacy which I think probably I haven't checked that, but probably it is better than Turkey is probably better than anywhere else in the Middle East."
