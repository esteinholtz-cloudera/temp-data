And actually, before we get into that, it's interesting to note that in many of these demonstrations you see in the university campuses or in the streets, you see women with a job,, young women with hijab or next to those have to remove their hijab and they're together, basically protesting. That's the most interesting feature of this, uh, of these demonstrations and then men and women together against the segregation that the regime has imposed upon them in all these years. Now, in terms of what it represents, I pointed out, one is the question of the whole series of one might say, civil and legal discriminations against women. are considered as a kind of a second class citizen. depend on your men. There's a kind of a patriarchy that has been institutionalized in the Islamic Republic in a very profound fashion. that means that uh probably you in matters of divorce, uh marriage and divorce, in matters of custody of your Children, in matter of inheritance, in matter of uh freedom of movement. You depend on your husband, your father, your brother, a male member of your family, your child, even your your son, could be the case. And because of that, obviously, a younger generation who is so well informed through social media knows about the world as much as an American does. American kid does probably sometimes more. They're very very curious. It's from what I hear or sometimes that I met a few of them outside Iran. You'll see that. How did this new generation is different from what the Islamic Republic wanted to create in its social engineering. It's basically the failure of 43 years of the Islamic Republic's act of imposition of a certain so called Islamic values on, on women. And then it's a matter of education. You would see that there is segregation in the schools. uh One of the issues that now right now is at the heart of this demonstration is that self services in many of the campuses of the Iranian universities are segregated, male and female to different rooms, to different halls. Now they are breaking through the walls virtually everywhere and sit together in order to uh basically uh resist uh the authorities who wants to impose segregation uh in matters of uh in the public. Of course, it, it may seem to us as a kind of trivial and secondary, but appearance is important. Clothing is important, how you would imagine yourself is important. They don't want to be seen in the way that the authorities would like to impose upon them as this kind of an idea of a chaste Islamic woman who is fully covered is fully protected. The idea of a male member of the family protects uh the female. That is what you would see at the heart of this uh uh rebellion. And of course, that goes with everything else. The second part of this message, the idea of life means if you like to use the American equivalent of this pursuit of the happiness, that's what they want, they want fun, they want music, they want dancing, they want to be free in the street, they want to have boyfriends live freely and uh don't be constantly looked by the big brother to tell them what to do and not to do or, or not to do. So that is uh that they share with virtually with the entire, with the entire Iranian society as of all. Although the older generations, that's a big puzzle. But you would see that the older generation don't so far, at least don't take part extensively as one might, might imagine. And this is variety of reasons. Perhaps we can get to that later on if you like. Uh but as far as this younger generation, they don't care, they don't listen even as much to their parents as the older generations did. So all the or one might say even the nature of the relationship between the parents and the youth has changed. not the concept of, again, a ma a patriarchy that a father or even a mother would tell the daughter or son what to do because basically they have to negotiate. It's"
