  "Text": "a huge amount of hatred. the hatred is gone. Yes. Hatred of the, of the policies of the regime of isolation. That's a huge point that you hear a great deal about. don't want to be isolated, we don't want to be humiliated. Iran is not about this mis this miserable regime that is uh ruling over us. We have a great culture. So there's a sense of a pride in their own uh culture, some of its uh you know, Islamic, some of it pre Islamic. So they, there's a huge um um uh sense of a pride in that they see that they cannot communicate with the outside world. They, they want to travel abroad, which they do. I mean uh for one thing, the Iranian regime never actually uh for majority of the population never puts restrictions. It's not like where is it Soviet Union where you have to have a uh you used to have a permission to move from one place to another. And then of course, the the Islamic regime since 1979 basically chased away or destroyed the old middle class. That's my generation, basically, my parents' generation, these are the secular middle class of the Pahlavi era in the hope that they can do this social engineering and create this Islamic uh uh society of their own. The bad news for them that, that didn't happen. And that memory persisted and the middle class that was created since past 40 years is much larger in size than what it was. Because there was, of course, the demographic revolution that there's a very, there's a very foundation of it is the demographic revolution population in Iran. I've written an article about it actually population in Iran since uh the turn of the century, last century, this 20th century population of Iran was about 9 million or so now 83 million. that is since 1979 the population was 35 million between the past 40 years. It's basically doubled. So it's 83 million. Although uh one of the great successes, I don't want to bore you with the details about the demography, but it's important, you know,"
