  "Text": ". Not at all. People had very little sense that what Islamic Law is all about because the secular education has left that into the old religious schools. This is not something that ordinary educated Iranian who goes to the universities going to learn. And therefore there is a sense of idealization that there is something great there that is go. And there were quite a number of intellectuals who also view this kind of an idea of they would refer to as less toxic. That is this civilization of the West has brought with it. the modernity that we see around ourselves has its enormous sinister features into it. And it has taken away from us our authenticity. That was the thing that there is something authentic that should be protected and therefore a man and that's kind of a garb and appearance seemed as a source return to this originality of their own culture, authenticity of their own culture. And it perfectly uh uh uh took advantage of that. That is Khomeini took advantage of it and the circular around him at the expense of everybody else which he managed in the course of 1979 to 1989 which he passed, died in the 10 years during this period, managed to basically transform Iranian society uh to create institutions of the Islamic Republic to acquire himself the position of the guardian jurists that was something completely new did it ever existed before? As a matter of fact, as you might know, model of government that a religious establishment takes over the States unprecedented throughout the course of Iranian history, throughout the course of the Islamic history. I would say this is the first example and probably the only example of a, of a regime the religious establishment that has always in the course of Iranian history ever since I would say probably at this 16th century, if not earlier, has been always from the state always kind of collaborating with the state in a with a certain tensions in between the two of them. There were two basically as they would call themselves the two pillars of stability in the society. situation changed for the first time, the religious establishment took over power of the state. And that's at the core of what we see today as a major issue for Iranian society. Because these are basically that old balance between the religion and the state, which was kind of a de facto separation of the authorities of the two has been violated. And now you have power, the theocracy in effect, which of course, only in the on the on in its appearance is theocracy deep down. It's a, in my opinion, is a brutal fascist regime that it stays in power, but it has the appearance of religion into it. this is really the story of the revolution. as a result of that, the Iranian middle class is greatly suffered. It's not without a reason that you see 4 million Iranians abroad. Because basically the emergence of this new power gradually isolated or marginalized the secular middle class who could not survive under that regime gradually moved out uh in the course of perhaps 3040 years up to now, Iran has the largest, I think I'm right to say. So has the largest brain drain in any country in the world to its population?"
