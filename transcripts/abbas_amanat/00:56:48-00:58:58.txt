  "Text": "is that they say we have it all, you know, we have our parliament, we have our constitution, we have our elections which has all been of course fake, but they claim they have all of that. the problem for them is that uh to superimpose certain ideology all other ideological uh autocracies or anarchy as in this case tend to dominate all this institution, buildings that they have. And they, they constantly claim we have this, we have that and of course, it's a generational thing. upper echelons of this regime mostly older people, tavern, they are the clergy are afraid of the fact that they may lose their control over their whole system that it was a sophisticated, huge system of government. And they rely on certain tools of control, which is the Revolutionary Guards other other institutions that are loyal to, to the state. And they spend enormous amount of funds that is available to them. At least before the sanctions. But even during the sanctions, they still have enough funds to do so in order to remain in power and they are extremely ruthless in that regard. This is not a nice Islamic fatherly. This is a regime that I would see easily in it. Uh clear signs of fascism, sense of the state's control and pay any price to stay in"
