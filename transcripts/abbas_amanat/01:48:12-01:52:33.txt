  "Text": ". Yeah, let me finish this about this period of my mare, the show he built up because he received a greater income from the oil revenue. And he built up a very strong state with a strong security force., it strong security apparatus, which is the Slovak is a uh which is the acronym for the security force in security organization. he, of course, unfortunately, in the 19 sixties and seventies, particularly in 19 seventies, basically suppressed the voices of or the possibility of any kind of a mass participation in the political uh process. It became very much an authoritarian regime with its own technocrats, much a modernist vision of, of of, of Iran's future and all kind of Messianic that he was hoping that Iran in a decade would become the fifth most powerful state in the world. And reaches, as he would have said, the gates of the great civilization very much in the mind, this image of ancient Iran of the Archimede Empire. And we want to go back to that greatness of the Archimedean Empire, somewhat rather naive and very nationalistic in a crude fashion. And what happened is that as a result, there was built up some kind of a resistance the intellectuals from the left, eventually resulting in a kind of a protest movement, as I said by 1977 1978. of course, the question that comes to mind and they probably it you, you, you you would like to know about is the fact that why it becomes religious, why it become Islamic? If it's the popular, you know, nationalist, liberal tendency of opening up the uh political uh uh space and allowing the greater participation, going back to the constitution of 1906, 1907. Why it's all of a sudden it becomes Khomeini. Where does he come from? The reason for that, at least in a concise fashion is the fact that on one area the greater suppression of all the other voices remained open with religion, masks, molars on the pulpit the message that gradually shifted the all the traditional message of the Sharia of Islam. I mean, all the rules and regulations of how one has to live into something very political and not only political but also radical political. So the whole period from the constitutional revolution to the revolution of 1979 basically, the religious establishment gradually was pushed to the opposition. They were not originated with very conservative supporters of state as the Catholic church, for instance, was supported of majority of the authoritarian governments around the world. the politicization was the result of isolation they were left out of the system. And while in isolation, they did, they did not, they were not successful in to reform themselves to try to become to try to find answers to many of the questions of modern times. What happens to women? What happens to civil rights what happens to a civil society, how the modern law and individual freedoms have to be defined in Islamic terms,"
