  "Text": "also the fact that it's in fact fulfillment in a kind of completely uh unintended fashion is the fulfillment of that idea of a messiah that they've been fighting for this Imam, which is in a head for 1000 years, is here and not here. therefore Khomeini would have in a sense, fulfilled those anticipations. But beyond that, I just give you one example, I know that you may have other concerns. But when I say elimination at the end of the Iran Iraq war by the direct order of Ayatollah Khomeini, a fatwa that he wrote a group of prisoners belong to variety of, uh, parties. The left religious left, of them,, the left and the, uh, the Marxist left and the religious left,, in a matter of a few weeks or perhaps a few months, I'm not actually quite sure about the, the time span., in a series of these were people who have already been tried and they were given, uh, sentences, they were brought back the uh uh summary trials of three judges or or more 34 of them. One of them is now the new president of the Islamic Republic rai they were given AAA quick summary sentences which meant uh execution. So something between probably 6 to 8000 were executed in a matter of a month or two months, something like that, in Tehran, but also in provinces. And that remained an extraordinary trauma for the families, for those who had these kids and they're all young, all young. this remains very much uh of uh original sin of the Islamic Republic that cannot get rid of. And it's in people's memories. They didn't allow them even the families to go and mourn, dead in a unofficial symmetry which they created for them. Now, the latest thing is that they put a huge concrete wall around it so nobody would be able to get into it. So this all part of this extraordinary level of level of atrocity brutality that you see that the regime claimed it comes with the morality of religion and Islam to bring back to justice and, and, and be more a sense kind to people ended up with what it is in the memory of many of the people in Iran."
