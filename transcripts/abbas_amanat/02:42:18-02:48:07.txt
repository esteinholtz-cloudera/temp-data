  "Text": "opening a new can of worms that it takes another three hours of, of of conversation? Just three hours. At least. What, what I can tell you is this prior to 1979 itself under the shore as a kind of a not supporter of Israel was in very good terms with Israel. had an embassy in Iran or unofficial embassy in Iran. They had certain projects that's helping with the agriculture and so forth in Iran. since 1979 completely reversed. of it is that the issue of the Palestinian plight remained very much at the heart of revolutionary Iranians would see that part of the United States is to support part of the United States guilt. is to support Israel a vis it's very suppressive, uh very treatment of the Palestinians completely illegal taking over of the territories which is not theirs since 1967. therefore it is upon the Iranian regime Iranian Islamic Republic to support the cause of the Palestinians. came about at the time rest of the support for the Palestinians, including Arab nationalism the stage of bankruptcy. mean much of the regimes of the Arab world either are now coming to terms with Israel or in one way or another because of their own contingencies, because of their own and interests are willy-nilly accepting Israel in the in the region. Now, that old task of rhetorically supporting the Palestinians falls upon the Islamic Republic sees itself as the champion of the Palestinians. Now without, as a matter of fact, having either the support of the Iranian people behind him. If you ask, if tomorrow there would be a poll or a referendum, I would doubt that of the Iranian people would approve of the policies of the Islamic Republic vis a vis the issue of Palestine nor the Palestinians themselves because the Islamic Republic is only supporting those factions within the Palestinian uh uh movement, which are Islamic quote unquote. And even within that state, there is problems with Hamas for instance. nevertheless, it's for the Islamic Republic, some kind of a propaganda tool to be able to use it for its own sake claim that uh we are the champions of the Palestinian people. do they have a solution? you look at the rhetoric, if you listen to the rhetoric, it's the destruction of the state of Israel. that's it seems to me creates a certain anxiety in the minds of the Israelis, Israeli population and the Israeli government, particularly those who are now in power. Netanyahu, the likud and more kind of a right wing politics of poli polity of today's Israel being said, I think also the Israelis try to get an extra mileage out of threat of Iran quote unquote order to themselves rightful to, for terms of security and whatever else, the way that they are treating the Palestinians, which I think is extremely unjust. I think it's extremely unwise for Israel to carry on with these policies as they did since 67 at least and not to try to come to terms with it. Of course, there are huge amount of, I'm not denying that at all the huge amount of uh failures, mistakes stupidity on the side of the Palestinian leadership in various stages, not to try to make a deal or try to come to terms in some fashion. But it's a very complex picture and it's rather unfair to the Palestinians accuse them for not coming to terms with Israel under a very uneven circumstances when they are not in a position to try to make a fair deal in terms of the territories in terms of their security and future. Vis a vis Israel."
