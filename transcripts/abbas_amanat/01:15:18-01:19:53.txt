  "Text": "of. Well, that is the point. I think I revolutionary guys may be an extreme, but many of the people who depend on this state for their support., the younger generation are telling their parents you were wrong. You don't provide for us this society, this state does not provide what we want. So there is a dissent within the family. It seems to me, I hope it's not a wishful thinking. You know, there is a kind of a joke going around. You see this A T guy is the clergy, bearded traditional appearance. you see them uh talking about women, are very, of course, politically correct. They are very looking down towards women as as I said, you know, they have to be inside, they have to be protected, they have not to be seen and so forth. But if they have a young person, young daughter in their family, you see that there uh discourse changes, they no longer seem to be referring to women as second class. Is that so that's very important. That's precisely that point that when you have this younger generation, no matter how privileged they are and many of them are privileged, you know, and there is also regime has created its own, privileged class are not necessarily paid by the regime, but they benefit from contractors, certain professions that, that benefit from what the state provides for them. And Iran is a, I mean, the past 40 years, you can see Iran has developed in terms of material culture. Remarkably, has good communication as roads all over the place. It's not like a,, it's, it's more like, I don't know whether you have ever visited Turkey for instance, in certain respects, even more advanced than Turkey. But it's closer to that rather than if you travel, I don't want to bring particular names in North Africa parts of the Middle East or other parts of the Islamic world is much, much different. in this respect, you would see contrast or paradoxes here on the certain respect is the growth there is urbanization, there is modern economy. On the other hand, you see this superimposed ideological doctrinal aspect that has driven the regime over all these years they cannot get rid of it. They cannot in this respect, they cannot modernize themselves. They think that they are already perfect in ideological sense. This is the best solution for the world, not for only for Iran, but for the Muslim world and for the world as a whole, we are anti imperialist. We have managed to survive either under sanctions. This is all part of the rhetoric but of course, at a huge expense, the huge expense for their own population. And the point that we have raised is the fact that we now witness, there is a not only a generation gap between the youth their parents, there is a, a break in a sense from the older generations they are very distinctly the youth that has a different view of the world. Uh And it does not want to compromise whether they would be able to succeed or not, remains to be seen whether this regime is going to suppress it maybe. but it's actually to surface many of aspects of the weaknesses of this regime in power."
