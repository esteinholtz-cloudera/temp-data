  "Text": "notice that they have, I don't think even they have that kind of imagination precise to say what you have said that they would say that they're controlling the narrative. They basically say no, these are agents of, of the foreign powers and their families are all sold out and they are basically lost their loyalties to the Great Islamic Republic. therefore, they can be treated so brutally, they can be suppressed so brutally, which I haven't actually said what they are doing because I thought perhaps first we should talk about who these kids are in the street before we move on in about the response of the government. But one major factor which seems to add to the anxiety, well, the regime is extremely anxious now because they are in a position. It shows that they don't have the lack of confidence in a sense that they would see them reacting in a very forceful way because basically, they don't seem to have that kind of a confidence to allow this uh this message or the movement to air to be aired. the one element which corresponds to that is that there is a uh expatriate population of Iranians worldwide. There are probably now, according to some estimates, close to 4 million, even more Iranians abroad. And they're all over the world from Australia and New Zealand, Japan, Western Europe, uh Turkey and United States and Canada. So just to give you one example, last uh last uh Saturday, was a mass demonstrations in Berlin by the Iranians from Germany and all all over Europe, Western Europe. And it was at least, I think probably the conservative estimate was about 100,000, 100,000 Iranians showed up in Berlin demonstrating against the treatment of the women in Iran or the movement in Iran. government thinks obviously this must have been some by foreign powers and they want to destroy the Islamic Republic. not only that, but the propaganda is kind of ridiculous because uh I listened actually to how they portrayed it in the newspapers. I listened to the uh Iranian news that is officially controlled, government controlled news, and in the papers, much of the papers that are in the control of the government, one of them or actually uh the the major news program portrayed the demonstrations that 10,000 people showed up in Berlin and protested against the rising prices, rising rates for gas and oil in Germany. that's how they mislead in a very rather stupid fashion because probably 95% if not 100% of the Iranians are listening to person speaking media outside Iran. So it's a BBC uh person. There is Iran International, there are at least five or six of them that's"
