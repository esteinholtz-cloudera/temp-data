  "Text": "we should be because politicians usually just focus on the next election cycle, right? single most important thing I feel we humans have learned in the entire history of science is they were the masters of underestimation. We underestimated the size, of, of of cosmos. Again and again, realizing that everything we thought existed is just a small part of something grander right planet solar system, a galaxy, you know, clusters of Galaxies, universe. we now know that we have that the future has just so much more potential than our ancestors could ever have dreamt of this cosmos. if all of earth completely devoid of life, for Cambridge Massachusetts. I would, wouldn't it be kind of lame if all we ever aspired to was to stay in Cambridge Massachusetts forever and then go extinct in one week even though earth was gonna continue on for longer. That, that that sort of attitude I think we, we have now the cosmic scale, we can life can flourish on earth, not for, for four years, but for billions of years, I can even tell you about how to move it out of harm's way when the sun, sun gets too hot and, then we have so much more resources out here, which today, yeah, maybe there are a lot of other planets with bacteria or, or cow like life on them. But I of this, all this opportunity seems as far as we can tell to be largely dead like the Sahara desert. And yet we have the opportunity to help life flourish around this for billions of years. So, like, let's quit squabbling about some little border should be drawn 11 mile to the left, to right and look up into the skies and you realize, hey, you know, we can do such incredible things."
