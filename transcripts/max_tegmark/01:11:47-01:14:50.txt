  "Text": ", I don't think panicking is gonna in any way. It's not going to increase chances of things going well, either, even if you are in a situation where there is a real threat. Does it help if everybody just freaks out? No. Of course, of course not. I, I think, yeah, there are, of course ways in which things can go horribly wrong. Uh, uh, first of all, it's important we think about this thing, this, about the problems and risks to also remember how huge the upsides can be if we get it. Right. Right. Everything everything we love about society and civilization is a product of intelligence. So if we can amplify our intelligence with machine intelligence and not anymore lose our loved ones to what we're told is an incurable disease and things like this. Of course, we should aspire to that. So that can be a motivator. I think, reminding ourselves that the reason we try to solve problems is not just because trying to avoid gloom, but because we're trying to do something great. Uh, but then in, in terms of the risks, I think, um, really important question is to ask, what can we do today that will actually help make the outcome good, right. And uh dismissing the risk is not one of them. You know, I find it quite funny often when I'm in on discussion panels about these things, how the people who, who work for, for companies always there always like, oh, nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about. And it's always, it's only academics sometimes express concerns. not surprising at all. If you think about it up in Sinclair quipped, right. That, uh it's hard to make your man believe in something when his income depends on not believing in it. And, and frankly, we know a lot of these people in companies that they are just as concerned as anyone else. But if you're the ceo of a company, that's not something you want to go on record saying when you have silly journalists who are gonna put a picture of a terminator robot when they quote you. So, so the the the are real and, and the way I, the way I think about what the issue is, is basically, you know,, the real choice we have is of all, are we going to dismiss this the risks and say, well, you know, let's just go ahead and build machines that can do everything we can do better and cheaper. You know, let's just make yourself sle as fast as possible. What could possibly go wrong? That's one attitude, the opposite attitude I think is to say is incredible potential. You know, let, let's think about what kind of future we're really, really excited about are the shared goals we can really aspire towards. And then let's think really hard on how about how we can actually get there to start with. Not, don't start thinking about the risks, start thinking about the goals and then when you do that, then you can think about the obstacles you want to avoid, right? I often get students coming in right here into my office for career advice. I always ask them this very question. Where do you want to be in the future? all she can say is, oh, maybe I'll have cancer, maybe I'll get run over"
