  "Text": "it. And I don't think we need to be that defensive. I don't think anything good comes out of saying, oh, we're somehow special. You know, it, it, it's um, there are many examples in history of where to pretend that we're somehow superior to all other intelligent beings has led to pretty bad results, right? Germany. They said that they were somehow superior to other people. Uh Today, we still do a lot of cruelty to animals by saying that we're so superior somehow and the they can't feel pain. Uh Slavery was justified by the same kind of just really weak, weak arguments and, and, and uh don't think if we, if we actually go ahead and build artificial general intelligence, can do things better than us. I don't think we should try to found our self worth on some sort of claims of, of superiority in, in terms of our intelligence. think it, we should instead find our, our and, and the, the meaning of life from, from the experiences that we have, right? You know, I can have, I can have very meaningful experiences if there are other people who are smarter than me. You know, I go to a faculty meeting here and I was talking about something and then I suddenly realized, oh, he has an old prize, he has an old prize, he has an old prize. I don't have one. Does that make me enjoy life any less or enjoy talking to those people? Less? Of course not. You know. And contrary wise, II, I feel very honored and privileged to get to interact with, with uh other very intelligent beings that are better than me. A lot of stuff. So don't think there's any reason why we can't have the same approach with, with intelligence machines."
