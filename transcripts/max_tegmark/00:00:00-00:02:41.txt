  "Text": "Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence podcast. My name is Lex Friedman. I'm a research scientist at mit. This podcast is an extension of the courses on deep learning autonomous vehicles and artificial general intelligence that I've taught and organized. It is not only about machine learning or robotics or neuroscience or philosophy or any one technical field, considers all of these avenues of thought in a way that is hopefully accessible to everyone. aim here is to explore the nature of human and machine intelligence. The big picture of understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in the machine. me, that is one of our civilization's most challenging and exciting scientific journeys into the unknown. will first repost parts of previous youtube conversations and lecture Q and A's that can be listened to without video. If you want to see the video version, please go to my youtube channel. My user name is Lex Friedman there and on Twitter. So reach out and connect if you find these conversations interesting forward. This podcast will be long form conversations with some of the most fascinating people in the world who are thinking about the nature of intelligence. But first, like I said, I will be posting old content. But now in audio form for a little while, I'll probably repeat this intro for reposted youtube content like this episode and we'll try to keep it to what looks to be just over two minutes, maybe 230. in the future, if you want to skip this intro, just jump to the 2 30 minute mark in this episode, I talked with Max Tegmark. He's a professor at mit, a physicist who has spent much of his career studying and writing about the mysteries of our Cosmological universe. And now thinking and writing about the beneficial possibilities and existential risks of artificial intelligence. the co founder of the Future of Life Institute, author of two books, Our Mathematical Universe and Life 3.0 he is truly an out of the box thinker. So I really enjoyed this conversation. I hope you do as well. you think there's intelligent life out there in the universe? open up with an easy question."
