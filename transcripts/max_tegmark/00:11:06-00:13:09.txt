  "Text": ". And you know, you can see I have my favorite equations here describing various fundamental aspects of the world. I feel that I think one day maybe someone who's watching this will come up with equations that that information processing has to satisfy to be conscious. I'm quite convinced there is big discovery to be made there because let's face it some in we know that some information processing is conscious because are conscious. But we also know that a lot of information processing is not conscious. Like most of the information processing happening in your brain right now not conscious. There are like 10 megabytes per second coming in even just through your visual system, you're not conscious about your heartbeat regulation or or most things even even like if I just ask you to like, read what it says here, you look at it and then, oh, now, you know what it said, you're not aware of how the computation actually happened. You're like, your consciousness is like the CEO that got an email at the end with the, with the final answer. what is it? That makes a difference? I think that's uh both of us. Great science mystery. We're actually studying it a little bit in my lab here at MIT. Uh But I also think it's just a really urgent question to answer for starters. I mean, if you're an emergency room doctor and you have an unresponsive patient coming in, wouldn't it be great? If in addition to having T scanner, you had a consciousness scanner that could figure out whether this person is actually having locked in syndrome or is actually comatose and in the future, imagine if we build robots or the machine that could have really good conversations with, I think it is most very likely to happen. Right. Wouldn't you want to know, like if your home help, a robot is actually experiencing anything or just like a zombie? I mean, you prefer it? What would you prefer? Would you prefer that it's actually unconscious so that you don't have to feel guilty about switching it off or giving boring chores or what, what would you"
