  "Text": ", I agree that the, some, in a certain sense, the hardware processing power is, is already out there because our universe itself, can think of it as being a computer already. Right. It's constantly computing what water waves, how it evolved the water waves and the river char and how to move the air molecules around that. Seth Lloyd has pointed out my colleague here that you can even in a very rigorous way, think of our entire unive as, as being a quantum computer. It's pretty clear that our universe supports this amazing processing power you can even within this physics computer that we live in, right? We can even build actual laptops and stuff. So clearly the power is there. It's just that most of the compute power that nature has, it's in my opinion, kind of wasting on boring stuff like simulating yet another ocean wave somewhere where no one is even looking, right? So in a sense of what life does, what we are doing when we build computers is we're all this compute that nature is doing anyway, into doing things that are more interesting than just yet another ocean wave, you know, and let's do something cool here. Uh So the raw hardware power is there for sure. But, and, and, even just like computing what's going to happen for the next five seconds in this water bottle, you know, it takes a ridiculous amount of compute if you do it on a human computer, this water bottle just did it. But that does not mean that this water bottle has a G I and this, a G I means it should also be able to like have written my book, done this interview. And I don't think it's just communication problems. I don't think it can do it. And, and"
