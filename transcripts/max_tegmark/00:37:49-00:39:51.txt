  "Text": "is a, we should think of creativity simply as an aspect of intelligence. uh, we have to be very careful with, with human vanity. we, we have this tendency to very often want to say as soon as machines can do something, we try to diminish it and say, oh, but that's not like real intelligence, you know, because they're like creative or, or this or that the other thing. Um if we ask ourselves to write down a definition of what we actually mean by creative, what we mean by Andrew Wiles, what he did there, for example, don't we often mean that someone takes a very unexpected leap. not like taking f 573 and multiplying it by 224 by just a step of cookbook like rules, right? It is, you can maybe make it, you make a connection between two things that people have never thought was connected, surprising or something like that. I think, I think this is an aspect of intelligence and uh this is actually one of the most important aspects of it. the reason we humans are tend to be better at it than uh traditional computers is because it's something that comes more naturally if you're a neural network than if you're a traditional um logic gate based computer machine, you know, we physically have all these connections and if you activate here, activate here, activate here. You know, it, it's a, my, my hunch is that if we ever build a machine you could just give it the task. Say, hey, uh I,, you say, hey, you know, I, I just realized that have, I wanna travel around the world instead this month. Can you teach my a ag I course for me. And it's like, OK, I'll do it and it does everything that you would have done and improvises and stuff that, that would in my mind involve a lot of creativity."
