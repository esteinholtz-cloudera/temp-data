  "Text": "think it's all possible. And I mean, in, in recent, is a, there is a very wide range of guesses as you know, among A I researchers when we're gonna get a G I, people, you know, like our friend Rodney Brooks says it's going to be hundreds of years at least. And then there are many others that think it's going to happen much sooner in recent polls, half or so or A I researchers think that we're going to get a G I within decades. Uh So if that happens, of course, then I think these things are all possible. But in terms of whether it will happen, I know, think we shouldn't spend so much time asking what do we think will happen in the future as if we are just some sort of pathetic, passive bystanders, you know, waiting for the future to happen to us. Hey, we are the ones creating this future, right? So we should be about it and ask what sort of future we would like to have happen, trying to make it like that., what I prefer it to some sort of incredibly boring zombie like future where there's all these mechanical things happen, there's no passion, no emotion, no experience, maybe even, I would of course much rather prefer it. If all the things that we find that we value the most humanity, subjective experience, passion, inspiration, and love. You know, if, if if uh we can create a future where, where those are, those things do exist. You know, I think ultimately, not our universe giving meaning to us, it's us giving meaning to our universe. And if we build more advanced intelligence, let's, let's make sure we build it in such a way that is part of it."
