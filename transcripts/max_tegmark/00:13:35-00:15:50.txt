But if we want to make sure that what happens is a good thing, we better solve it first. So it's a wonderful controversy you're raising there there where you have um basically three points of view about the hard problem. So are two different points of view that both conclude that the hard problem of consciousness is BS. one hand, you have some people like Daniel Dennett who say this is consciousness is just BS because consciousness is the same thing as intelligence. There's no difference. So anything which acts conscious conscious like like we are. And then there are also a lot of people including many top A I researchers. I know who say, oh conscience is just bullshit because of course, machines can never be conscious. They're always gonna gonna be zombies. You never have to feel guilty about how you treat them. then there's a third group of people including Giulio Tononi for example, and, and another, and Christoph Cochran and my brothers, I would put myself was on this middle camp who say that actually some information processing is conscious and some is not. So let's find the equation which can be used to determine which it is. I think we've just been a little bit, kind of running away from this problem for a long time. It's been almost taboo to even mention the C word in a lot of circles because, but, but we should stop making excuses. This is a science question and we, and uh there are, there are ways we can even test, test any theory that makes predictions for this and coming back to this helper robot. I mean, so you said you would want to help a robot to certainly act conscious and treat you like you conversations with you and stuff? I think so. But wouldn't you, would you, would you feel a little bit creeped out if you realized that it was just up tape recorder? You know, there was this zombie and there's a faking emotion. Would you prefer that it actually had an experience or, or, or would you prefer that it's actually not experiencing anything? So you feel you don't have to feel guilty about what you do to it, it's such a,"
