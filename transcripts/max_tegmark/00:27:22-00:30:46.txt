  "Text": "does not come into this definition So, so I think of intelligence is, a spectrum but there are very many different kinds of goals you can have, you can have a goal to be a good chess player, a good goal player, a good car driver, good investor, good poet, et cetera. intelligence that by, by its very nature isn't something you can measure, but it's one number overall. Goodness. No, no, there's some people who are more better at this. Some people are better than that. Um Right now we have machines that are much better than us at some very narrow tasks like multiplying large numbers, fast, memorizing large databases, uh playing chess, playing, go soon, driving cars. Um but there's still no machine that can match human child in, in general intelligence. But, but artificial general intelligence A G I, the name of your course, of course, that is its very definition, the, the quest to build a machine that can do everything as well as we can up, up to the old holy grail of, of A I from, from back to its inception in the, in the sixties, that ever happens. Of course, I, I think it's gonna be the biggest transition in the history of, of life on earth. But it, but it doesn't necessarily have to wait the big impact around until machines are better than us at knitting. That the really big change doesn't come exactly at the moment. They're better than us at everything, the really big change comes. But first, there are big changes when they start becoming better allies at doing most of the jobs that we do because that takes away much of the demand for, for human labor. then the really whopping change comes when they become better than us at A I research, right? Because right now the time scale of A I research is by the human research and development cycle of of years. Typically, you know, how long does it take from one release of of some software or iphone or whatever to the next? once, once we have, once Google can replace 40,000 engineers by 40,000 equivalent of software or whatever. But then that doesn't, there's no reason that has to be years, it can be in principle much faster and uh the time scale of future progress in A I and also all of science and technology will will be driven by machines, not humans. So it it's this point, simple point which gives right, this incredibly fun controversy about whether there can be intelligence explosion, so called singularity as we inch called it. Now, the idea is articulated by IJ good is obviously way back fifties, but you can see Alan Turing and others thought about it even earlier. you asked me, what exactly would I define human level as? this the the glib answer is is to say something which is better than us at all cognitive tasks with a better than any human at all cognitive tasks. But the really interesting bar I think goes a little bit lower than that. Actually, it's when they can, when they're better than us at A I programming and, and, and a general learning so that they can, can if they want to better than us at anything by this study. So there"
