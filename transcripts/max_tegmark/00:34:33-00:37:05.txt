  "Text": "a tricky question because there are actually two parts to it, right? One of them is Kenneth that proof. You cannot prove that you can never write to the N plus B to the N equals three to that equals Z to the end for all integers, et cetera, et cetera. When, when N is bigger than two,, that's simply in the question about intelligence. Can you build machines that are that intelligent? I, I think by the time we get a machine that can come up with that level of proofs, probably quite close to a G I. Uh The se second question is a question about consciousness of wh when will we will, will and likely is it the such a machine will actually have any experience at all as opposed to just being like a zombie? And we expect it to have some sort of emotional response to this uh or anything at all akin to human emotion where, when it accomplishes its machine goal, it, it, it uh views it as somehow something very positive and, and, and sublime and, and, and, and, and deeply meaningful, would certainly hope that if in the future, we do create machines that are our peers even descendants, that I would certainly hope that they do have this sort of sublime, sublime appreciation of life in a way. My, my absolutely worst nightmare would be that. at some point in the future, distant future, maybe our cosmos is teeming with all this post biological life, doing all this seemingly cool stuff. maybe the last humans, by the time our, our species eventually out will be like, well, that's ok because we're so proud of our descendants here and look what my worst nightmare is that we haven't solved the consciousness problem and we haven't realized that these are all the zombies, they're not aware of anything more than the tape recorders that has any kind of experience. So the whole thing has just become a play for empty benches. That would be like the ultimate zombie apocalypse me. So II, I would much rather in that case that, have these beings, we really appreciate how the, the how amazing it is."
