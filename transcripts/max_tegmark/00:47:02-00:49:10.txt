  "Text": ", I think no better way to guarantee failure than to try to refuse to talk about it or, or refuse to try. And I also think it's a really bad strategy to say, ok, let's first have a discussion for a long time and then once we reach complete consensus, then we'll try to load it into the machine. No, we shouldn't let perfect be the enemy of good. Instead should start with the kindergarten ethics that pretty much everybody agrees on and put that into machines. Now, we're not doing that, even. Look at the, you know, anyone who builds a passenger aircraft to never under any circumstances fly into a building or a mountain. Right yet, the September 11th hijackers were able to do that. And even more embarrassingly, you know, Andreas Lubitz, this depressed Germanwings pilot when he flew his passenger jet into the Alps killing over 100 people. He just told the autopilot to do it. He told the freaking computer to change the altitude to 100 m and even though it had the GPS maps,, the computer was like, ok. No. So we sh we should take those very basic values though where the problem is not that we don't agree that the problem is just, we've been too lazy to try to put it into our machines and make sure that from now on air airplanes will just, which all have computers in them, but we'll just never just refuse to do something like that. Go into safe mode, maybe lock the cockpit door, go over the nearest the airport and, and so much other technology in, in our world as well now where it's really quite big coming quite timely to put in some sort of very basic values like this. Even in cars, we have, we've had enough, uh, vehicle terrorism attacks by now. If you have driven trucks vans into pedestrians that it's not at all a crazy idea that just have that hardwired into the car because yeah, there are a lot of, there's always gonna be people who for some reason want to harm others, but most of those people don't have the technical expertise to figure out how to work around something like that. So if the car just won't do it, helps. So let's, let's"
