  "Text": "have a minority view here. Actually, when I give public lectures, I often ask for a show of hands who thinks there's intelligent life out there somewhere else. And almost everyone put their hands up and when I ask why they'll be like, oh, there's so many Galaxies out there, there's gotta be, I'm in numbers nerd, right? So when you look more carefully at it, it's not so clear at all that the when we talk about our universe, first of all, we don't mean all of space, we actually mean, I don't know, you can throw me in the universe if you want behind you there. It's we simply mean the spherical region of space from which light has had time to reach us so far during the 14.8 billion year, 13.8 billion years. Since our big bang. more space here. But this is what we call a universe because that's all we have access to. So is there intelligent life here that's gotten to the point of building telescopes and, and computers? guess is no, actually the the probability of it happening on any given planet, some number, we don't know what it is. And um what we do know is that uh the number can't be super high because there's over a billion earth like planets in the milky way galaxy alone, many of which are billions of years older than earth. And um aside from some um UFO believers, now, there isn't much evidence that super civilization has come here at all. And so that's the famous Fermi paradox, right? And then if you, if you work the numbers, what you find is that um if you have no clue what the probability is of getting life on a given planet, it could be 10 to the minus 1010 to the minus 20 or 10 to the minus two or any power of 10 is sort of equally likely if you want to be really open minded, that translates into it being equally likely that our nearest neighbor is 10 to the 16 m away, 10 to the 17 m away. 10 to the 18., by the time he gets less than, than 10 to 16 already, we, we pretty much know there is nothing else that close. And when you"
