  "Text": ". So OK, so quantum mechanics is certainly a a beautiful mysterious formulation of our world. So I'd like to sort of ask you just as an example, it perhaps doesn't have the same beauty as physics does. But in mathematics uh abstract, the Andrew Wiles who proved the FMA last theory. I, he I just saw this recently and it, it kind of caught my eye a little bit. This is 358 years after it was, it was conjectured. So this very simple formulation, everybody tried to prove it, everybody failed. And so here's this guy comes along and eventually proves it and then fails to prove it and then proves it again in 94. And he said like the moment when everything connected into place in an interview, he said it was so indescribably beautiful that moment when you finally realize the connecting piece uh of two conjectures, he said it was so indescribably beautiful. It was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in the disbelief for 20 minutes., then during the day I walked around the department and I keep, keep coming back to my desk looking to see if it was still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself. I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much so that particular moment and, and it kind of made me think of what would it take. And I think you, we have all been there at small levels. Um let me ask, have you had a moment like that in your life where you just had an idea? It's like I, wow. Yes,"
