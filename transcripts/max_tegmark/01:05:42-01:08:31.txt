  "Text": "some Hollywood movies I will not mention my name because I don't want to spoil them the way they get a G I is building a quantum computer because the word quantum sounds cool. And so on first of all, I think we don't need quantum computers to build a G I suspect your brain is not computer in an a found sense. you don't even wrote a paper about that many years ago. I calculated the decoherence so called decoherence time that how long it takes until the quantum computers of of what your neurons are doing gets erased just random noise from the environment. And it it's about 10 to the minus 21 seconds. as cool as it would be to have a quantum computer in my head, I don't think that fast, you know, on the other hand, there are cool things you could do with quantum computers I think we'll be able to do soon when we get big, one, bigger ones that might actually help machine learning do even better than the brain. So example,, this is just a Moonshot. But um, hey, uh you know that, that, very much same thing as search if, if you have a, if you're trying to train a neural network to get really learned to do something really well, you have some lost function. You have some, you have a bunch of knobs, you can turn represented by a bunch of numbers and you're trying to tweak them so that it becomes as good as possible at this thing. So if you think of a landscape with, with some valley each dimension of the landscape corresponds to some number you can change, you're trying to find the minimum. And it's well known that if you have a very high dimensional landscape, complicated things, it's super hard to find the minimum, right? mechanics is amazingly good at this. Like if I want to know what's the lowest energy state, this water can possibly have hard to compute, but we we can but nature will happily figure this out for you. If you just cool it down, make it very, very cold. you put a ball somewhere, it'll roll down to its minimum. And this happens metaphorically at the energy landscape too. And, and quantum mechanics even use some little some clever tricks which today's machine learning systems don't like if you're trying to find the minimum and you get stuck in the little local minimum here in quantum mechanics, you can actually tunnel through the barrier and get unstuck again. And, um that's really interesting. Yeah. So it, so it may, for example, we one day use quantum computers that help train neural networks better."
