  "Text": "? Well, altogether, I don't assign great importance to prizes because as you said, you know, Jean Paul Suter, who I admired as a teenager because I was interested in philosophy when I grew up on a farm in Israel. Uh you know, I used to collect eggs every afternoon and I would drive the tractor to the hills of our village and just think about philosophy, read philosophy books. And J Paul Sada was one of my favorite and was honored with the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was a philosopher, primarily existentialist and he said the hell with it, you know, why should I give um special attention to this committee of people that get their self importance from awarding me the prize? Like what, what's uh you know, why, why does that merit my attention? So he, he gave up on the Nobel Prize and you know, that two benefits to that one you don't, you're not working your entire life in the direction that would satisfy the will of other people. You know, that you work independently, you, you're not after these honors for the same reason that you are, if you're not living your life for making a profit or money, you can live a more fulfilling life because you are not being swayed by the wind, you know, of how to make money and so forth. Uh The, the second aspect of it is, you know, that um very often, um know, these prizes, um they, um they, they distort the way we do science because instead of um people willing to take risks and instead of having uh announcements, only after a group of people converges with a definite result, know, uh the natural progression of science is based on trial and error, you know, so reporting some results and perhaps they are wrong. But then other people find perhaps better evidence and then you figure out what's going on and that's the natural way that science is, you know, it's a learning experience. So if you give the public an image by which scientists are always right, you know,, and, and, you know, some of my colleagues say we must do that because otherwise the public will never believe us that global warming is really taking place. But that's not true because the public would really believe you if you show the evidence. So the point is you should be sincere when the evidence is not absolutely clear or where there are disputes about the interpretation of the evidence, which you know the king is naked. OK. There is no point in pretending that the king is dressed, saying that scientists are always right. Scientists are wrong frequently and the only way to make progress is by evidence, giving us the support that we need to make airtight arguments. So when you say global warming is taking place, if the evidence is fully supportive, if there are no holes in the argument, people will be convinced because you're not trying to fool them. When the evidence was not complete, you also show them that the evidence is not"
