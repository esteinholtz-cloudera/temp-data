  "Text": "thing that worries me the most is that people pay attention to how many likes they have on Twitter., uh, rather than, you know, basketball coaches tell the team players, your eyes on the ball, not on the audience. The problem is we keep our eyes on the audience most of the time. Let's keep our eyes on the ball. And what does that mean? First of all, in context of science? It means pay attention to the evidence. When the evidence looks strange, we should figure it out. You know, I went to a, a seminar about Umu AUA at Harvard and um a colleague of mine that is uh mainstream conservative never say anything that would deviate from what everyone else is thinking, said to me after the seminar. wish this object never existed. to me. I mean, I just couldn't hear that. What do you mean nature is whatever it is, you have to pay attention to it. You, you cannot say I, you know, you cannot bury your head in this. I mean, you should bless nature for giving you clues about things that you haven't expected. And I think that's the biggest fault that we are looking for confirmations of things we already know so that we can maintain our pride, that we already knew it maintain our image, not make mistakes because we already knew it. Therefore, we expected the right thing. But science is a learning experience and sometimes you're wrong and let's learn from those mistakes. And what's the problem about that? Why is why do we have to get, you know, prizes and why do we get to be honored and maintain our image when the actual objective of science is learning about nature?"
