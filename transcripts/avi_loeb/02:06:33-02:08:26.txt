  "Text": "quickly. And uh so we see those black holes and that was found in the mid 19 sixties, but 19, in sorry, in 2015, exactly 100 years after Einstein came up with his theory of gravity, the Ligo Observatory detected gravitational waves and these are just ripples in space and time. So according to Einstein's theory, the the the innovation, the ingenuity of Einstein's theory of gravity that was formulated in November 1915 was to say that space and time not rigid, you know, they are, they respond to matter. So for example, if you have two black holes and they collide, just like a stone being thrown into the on the surface of a pond, they generate waves uh disturbances in space and time that propagate out at the speed of light. These are gravitational waves, they create a spacetime storm around them and then the waves go all the way through the universe and reach us. And if you have a sensitive enough detector like Ligo, you can detect these waves. And it was not just the message that we received for the first time gravitational waves, but it was the messenger. So there are two aspects to it. One is the messenger which is gravitational wave for the first time were detected directly. And the second was the message which was a collision of two black holes because we could see the pattern of the ripples in space and time. And it was fully consistent the prediction that Schwartz had made for how a black the space time around the black hole is. Because when two black holes collide, you can sort of map from the message that you get, you can reconstruct what what really happened and it's fully consistent."
