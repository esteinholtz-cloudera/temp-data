  "Text": "then that must be copies of Christ. Yeah. So that was offensive. So I said, I said to that, um I said to that professor, I said, great, you know, I, I wanted to introduce some scientific tone to the discussion and I said this is great because now you basically laid the foundation for an experimental test of this theology. What is the test? now know that other stars are like the sun we know they have planets like the earth around them. So suppose we find life there and we figure out that they sinned, we ask them, did you witness Christ? And if they say no, it means that this this theology is ruled out. there is an experimental test. So this is experimental test. Number one, another experimental test, you know, uh in the Bible, you know, in the Old Testament, Abraham uh heard the voice, the voice of God to sacrifice his son, right? Only son. And uh that's what the story says. Now, suppose Abraham, my name, by the way, had a voice memo up on his cell phone. He could have pressed this up and recorded the voice of God. And that would have been experimental evidence that God exists, right?, he didn't, but it's an experimental test, right? There is a third example I should tell and that is Elie Wiesel attributed this story to Martin Buber, but it's not clear whether it's true or not at any event. The story goes that Martin Buber, you know, he was a philosopher and he said, know, the Christians argue that Jesus, you know, the the Messiah arrived already and will come back again in the future. The Jews argue that the Messiah never came and will arrive in the future. he said, why argue both sides agree that the Messiah will arrive in the future? When the messiah arrives, we can ask whether he or she came before, you know, like visited us and then figure it out and one side. So again, experimental test of a theology. So even theology, if it puts in the game, you know, if it makes a prediction could be tested, right? Uh So why can't string theorists test themselves or why can't, you know, even cosmic inflation? That's another model that uh you know, one of the inventors from MIT Alan Guth argues that it's not falsifiable. Uh I ar my point is theory that cannot be falsified is not helpful because it means that you can't make progress, you cannot improve your understanding of nature. The only way for us to learn about nature is by making hypotheses that are testable, doing the experiments and learning whether we are correct or not. So be"
