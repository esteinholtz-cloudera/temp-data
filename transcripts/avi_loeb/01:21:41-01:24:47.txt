  "Text": "think to answer this question, we need better evidence. Um starting point as I said, out of modesty is that we are not particularly interesting and therefore I would, I would be hard pressed to imagine that someone wants to really spy on us. Uh So I would think, you know, as a starting point that we don't deserve attention and we shouldn't expect someone. But who knows. Now, the problem that I have with UFO citing reports is, you know, 50 years ago, there were some reports of fuzzy images, you know, ser like uh things uh by now, our technologies are much better. Our cameras are much more sensitive. These fuzzy images should have turned into crisp clear images of things that we are confident about and they haven't turned that way. It's always on the borderline of believability. because of that, I believe that it might be most likely artifacts of our instruments or some natural phenomena that we are unable to understand. Now, of course, the reason you, you need, you must examine those if for example, pilots report about them or the military finds evidence for them is because it may pose a national security threat. If another country has technologies that we don't know about and they are spying on us, we need to know about it. And therefore we should examine everything that looks unusual, but to associate it with an alien is a little too far for me until we have evidence that stands up to the level of scientific credence, you know, that, that we are 100% sure that, you know, for multiple detectors and uh you know, uh through a scientific process. Now again, if the scientific community shies away from these reports, we will never have that it's like saying, I don't want to take photographs of something because I know what it is, you will never know what it is. But I think if, if some sci if grants, let's put it this way, if funding will be given to scientists to follow on some of these reports and use scientific instruments that are capable of detecting those sightings with much better resolution with much better information. That would be great because it will clarify the matter. You know, these are not, you said, you know, hundreds of thousands, these are not the once in a lifetime event. So it's possible to take scientific instrumentation and explore, go to the ocean where the, you know, someone reported that there are frequent uh events that are unusual and check it out. Do a scientific experiment. What's the problem? Why not? only do experiments deep into the ocean and look at the ocean oceanography or, or do other things? You know, we can do scientific investigation of these sightings and figure out what, what they mean. Uh I'm very much in favor of that. Uh But until we have the evidence, I would be doubtful as to what they actually mean."
