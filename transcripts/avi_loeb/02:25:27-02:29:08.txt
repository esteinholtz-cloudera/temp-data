  "Text": ". So in in physics, the biggest challenge is to unify quantum mechanics with gravity. And I believe that once we have experimental evidence for how this happens in nature um in systems that have quantum mechanical effects, but also gravity is important, then the theory will fall into our lap. OK. the mistake that uh is made by the community right now is to come up uh with the right theory from scratch. Uh And you know, Einstein gave the illusion that you can just sit in your office and and understand nature, you know, when he came up with his general theory of relativity. But uh you know, first of all, perhaps he was lucky. But it's not a rule uh the rule is that you need evidence to guide you, especially when dealing with quantum mechanics, which is really uh not intuitive. And um there are two places where uh the two theories meet. Uh one is black holes and there is a puzzle there. It's called the information paradox. Um In principle, you can throw the encyclopedia Britannica into a black hole. It's a lot of information. and then it will be gone because a black hole carries only three properties or qualities the mass, the charge and the spin according to Einstein. But then when Hawking tried to bring in quantum mechanics to the game, he realized that black holes have a temperature and they radiate this is called Hawking radiation. And it was sort of anticipated by uh Bekenstein before him and Hawking wanted to prove Bekenstein wrong and then figure this out. Um And so what it means is black horse eventually evaporate they evaporate into radiation that doesn't carry this information according to Hawking's calculation. And then the question is according to quantum mechanics information must be preserved. So where did the information go if uh a black hole is gone? And where, where is the information that was encoded in the encyclopedia when it went into the black hole? And that question, we don't have an answer yet. It's one of those puzzles about black holes and it touches on the interplay between quantum mechanics and and gravity. important question is what happened at the beginning of the universe, what happened before the Big Bang? by the way on that, I should say, you know, there are some conjectures. Uh it's all in principle. If we figure it out, if we have a theory of quantum gravity, it's possible to imagine that we will figure out how to create a universe in the laboratory by irritating the vacuum, you might create a baby universe. And if we do that, will offer a solution to what happened before the Big Bang. Perhaps the Big Bang emerged from the laboratory of another civilization. So it's like baby universes are being born out of laboratories and inside the baby universe, you have a civilization that brings to existence a new baby universe. So just like humans, right, we have babies and they make babies. So in principle, that would solve the problem of there was a Big Bang. And also what happened before the Big Bang. So we came, our umbilical cord is connected to a laboratory of a civilization that produced our universe. Once it figured out quantum gravity, you know, it's"
