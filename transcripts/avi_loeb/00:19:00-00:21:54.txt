  "Text": ", it will be. I should say something about a I because I do think it offers a very important step into the future. If you look at the Old Testament, the Bible, is this story about Noah's Ark that you might know about Noah uh knew about a great flood that is about to endanger all life on earth. So he decided to build an Ark and the Bible actually talks about specifically what the, the size of this ark was, what the dimensions were. Turns out, it was quite similar to um a mua that we will discuss in a few minutes. But at any event, he built this Ark and he put on it so that they were saved from the great flood. Now, you can think about doing the same on earth because there are risks for future catastrophes. You know, we could have the self inflicted wounds that we were talking about like nuclear war, changing the climate or there could be an asteroid us just like the dinosaurs died. You know, the, the dinosaurs didn't have science astronomy, they couldn't have a warning system, but there was this big stone, big rock that approached them. It must have been a beautiful site just when it was approaching, got very big and then smashed them. OK, and killed them. So um you could have a catastrophe like that or in a billion years, the sun will basically boil off all the oceans on earth. And then currently all our eggs are in one basket, but we can spread them. sort of like uh the printing press. If you think about it, the revolution that Gutenberg brought is there were very few copies of the Bible at the time and each of them was precious because it was handwrit. But once the printing press produced multiple copies, you know, if something bad happened to one of the copies, it wasn't a catastrophe. You know, it wasn't disaster because you had many more copies that. And so if we have copies of life on earth elsewhere, then we avoid the risk of it being eliminated by a single point, breakdown catastrophe. So the question is, can we build nox spaceship that will carry life as we know it? Now, you might think we have put elephants and whales and birds on a big spaceship. But that's not true because all you need to know is the DNA making the genetic making of these animals, put it on a computer system that has a I plus a 3d printer. that this cub set which is rather small, can go with this information to another planet and use the raw materials there to produce synthetic life. And uh that would be a way of producing copies just like the Gutenberg printing"
