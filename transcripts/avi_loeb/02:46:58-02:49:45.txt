  "Text": ", they might be wiser because they lived around for a while. But I'm afraid they will, they will be silent. I'm afraid they will not have a good answer. And I think, um,, it's the process that you should get, uh satisfied by the process of learning you should enjoy. OK. So it's not so much that there is a meaning. I, in fact, there is far as I can tell things just exist, you know, and, um, and it's, um, I think it's inappropriate for us to assign a meaning for our existence because, you know, we as a civilization, we will eventually perish, you know, and uh nothing will be, you know, just another planet on which life died, you know. And you look at the big scheme of things, who cares? Yeah, like who cares? And uh how can we assign significance to what we are doing? You know. So if you said the meaning of life is this,, it will not be around in a billion years. So what you know, it, it cannot be the meaning of life because life you know, nothing will be around. So I think we should just enjoy the process and then, know, it's like many other things in life. You enjoy good food. OK? And you can enjoy learning why? Because it makes you uh appreciate better where you know, the environment that you live in. And sometimes people think religion, for example, is in conflict with science, con con that's not true. Uh If you see a watch and then you look at it from the outside, know, you might say, oh, that's interesting. But then if you start to open it up and learn about how it works, you appreciate it more. So science is the way to learn about how the world works. And not in conflict to this, the meaning that you assign to all of this, but it helps you appreciate the world better. So, in fact, I would think that a religious person should science because it gives you a better appreciation of what's around you. You know, it's like, you know, if you buy, uh, in, in a grocery, buy something, you know, AAA, bunch of, uh,, uh, that are packed together and you can't see from the outside exactly what kind of fruits are inside. But if you open it up and study, you appreciate better the merchandise that you get, right? So you pay the same amount of money, but at least you know what's inside. So why don't we figure out what the world is about? You know, what the universe contain, what is the dark matter? It will help us appreciate, you know, the bigger picture and then you can assign your own flavor to what it means. You know,"
