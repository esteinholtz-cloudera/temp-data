  "Text": ". Um Well, first, I should confess that I enjoy working with young people much more than with senior. And the reason is, they don't carry a baggage of prejudice. They're not so self centered. They're open to exploration. My advice. I mean, one of the lessons that took me a while to learn and I should say I, I lost important opportunities as a result of that so that I would regard it as a mistake on my behalf was to believe experts, so quote unquote. Um So, um on a number of occasions, I would come up with an original idea and then suggest it to an expert, someone that works in the same field for a while the, the expert would dismiss it most of the time because it's new was not explored, not because of the merit. then what happened to me several times is that someone else would listen to the conversation or would hear me suggesting it and I would give up because the experts said no. And then that's someone else, know, would develop it so that it becomes the hottest thing in this field. And it ha you know, once it happened to me multiple times, I then realized the hell with the experts, you know, like they don't know what they're doing. They're just repeating the, they don't think creatively, they are being threatened by innovation. OK? And then it's the natural reaction of someone that cares about their ego more than about the matter that we are discussing. And so I said, I would not, I don't care how many likes I have on Twitter. I don't care whether the experts say one thing or another. I will basically exercise my judgment and do the best I can. You know, turns out that I'm wrong. I made a mistake. You know, that's part of the, of the scientific endeavor, you know, and, um, it took me a while to recognize that and it was a lot of wasted opportunities. So to the young people, I would recommend don't listen experts carve your own path. Now, of course, you will be wrong. You should learn from experience just like kids do, but do it yourself."
