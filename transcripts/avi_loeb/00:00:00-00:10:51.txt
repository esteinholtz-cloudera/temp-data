  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist astronomer and cosmologist at Harvard. He has authored over 800 papers and written eight books, including his latest called Extraterrestrial. The First Sign of Intelligent Life beyond Earth. be released in a couple of weeks. So go preorder it now to show support for what I think is truly an important book in that. It serves as a strong example of a scientist being both rigorous and open minded about the question of intelligent alien civilizations in our universe. Quick mention of our sponsors, zero Fasting app for intermittent fasting element, electrolyte, drink, sun, basket meal delivery service, and pessimist archive history podcast. the choice is a fasting app, fasting fuel, fast breaking, delicious meals and a history podcast that has very little to do with fasting, choose wisely my friends. And if you wish, click the sponsor links below to get a discount and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say a bit more about why Avi's work is so exciting to me. And I think to a lot of people 2017, a strange interstellar object now named AOA SF was detected traveling through our solar system. Based on the evidence we have, it had strange characteristics which made it not like any asteroid or comet that we've seen before. Avi was one of the only world class scientists who fearlessly suggested that we should be open minded about whether it is naturally made or in fact, is an artifact of an intelligent alien civilization. fact, he suggested that the more likely explanation given the evidence is the latter hypothesis. But we also talk about a lot of fascinating mysteries in our universe, including black holes, dark matter, the Big Bang and close to speed of light space travel. theme throughout is that in scientific pursuits, the weird things, the anomalies, the ideas that right now are considered taboo should not be ignored if we're to have a chance at finding the next big breakthrough, the next big paradigm shift. And also if we are to inspire the world with the power and beauty of science, you enjoy this thing, subscribe on youtube review on Apple podcast, follow on Spotify, support on Patreon or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and no ads in the middle. I try to make these interesting but I do give you time stamps. So go ahead and skip if you must but do check out the sponsors by clicking the links in the description. It really is the best way to support this podcast. episode is brought to you by zero fasting, the world's most popular fasting app. I think it's probably popular for a good reason. Since when I use it, I really enjoy using it for all the fasting that I do. This is a trial run with them. So please go to zero fasting.com/lex to show your support. Since given how much I love this app. I hope they sign up to support this podcast for the long term. may know and maybe even have gotten sick of me talking about it. But I fast a lot intermittent fasting for 1618, 24 hours every day. And I'm thinking of fasting for 72 hours, maybe even more soon. I'll use the app to track my progress and maybe if you sign up, we can do it together. I'll post something about it ahead of time on social media and maybe a video explaining different aspects of why fasting has been so beneficial for my life. really just been a game changer for even sports because to me, sports requires skill and skill requires mental focus and fasting helps with mental focus. Obviously, you have to do it right. The app helps with that, especially their premium, whatever it's called Zero plus service because it has a lot of educational content. if you do it right. Trust me, it's a game changer. You should definitely sign up to their Zero plus, that's what it's called service like I did, which is $70 a year normally. But if you use zero fasting.com/lex, you'll get 30% off. So it will be $50. It's packed with a bunch of features for stats, timing, educational material and ability to ask questions of people like Dr Peter Attia, I think I will definitely talk to venture on this podcast probably sometime soon. I think the paid version of this app called Zero Plus is definitely worth the money. And again, this is the time to sign up if you're going to do it because it's a great way to support this podcast. Ok. This episode is also brought to you by Element spelled LMNT. This goes along really nicely with the Zero Fasting app that. Like I said, my diet has been a low carb one for many years now, mostly Keto. I'm actually currently on Carnivore when I do keto. It's 2030 g of carbs a day when it's carnivore. Obviously, it's very close to zero carbs a day., the fasting aspect again is 1624 hours. I'm thinking of doing more. But really the thing that you learn that there's a few tricks to doing it, right? I mean, it's the same thing that people repeat over and over when you look on Reddit or the various blogs is that you should stay hydrated and you get enough electrolytes in your system. And that's where element comes in. It's my go to electrolyte drink mix for avoiding any kind of bad feelings. Some people call it the keto flu on the keto diet or just fasting in general. If you are on a low carb diet, I also recommend drinking it before prolonged exercise. I love taking it before long runs for like anything over. I would say five or six miles for 10 plus miles. It's basically essential for me. teams use it. Olympians use it tech. People use it. I swear by this stuff along with the keto diet, try it. Risk free with free shipping. If you don't like it, they'll give you your money back. No questions asked. They're obsessed with good customer service, but I'm pretty sure nobody really complains, everyone loves their products. So go to drink element.com spelled LMNT. So drink lmt.com/lex, drink. I'm pretty sure you know how to spell a drink. Lmnt.com/lex. show is also sponsored by Sun Basket. They deliver fresh healthy delicious meals straight to your door. As you may know the whole keto carnivore diet thing is pretty minimalist. It lacks excitement. So sometimes it's nice to add a low carb, fun healthy variety into the mix. And that's where Sun Basket comes to the rescue. For me. make it easy and convenient with everything pre portioned and ready to prep and cook. You know, all the nutrition, you know, all the carbs, you know, all the calories, all that kind of stuff. You can enjoy a delicious healthy dinner in as little as 15 minutes. This is true. I've enjoyed a lot of meals from their menu that they label as carb conscious. I think they're trying to avoid certain kinds of terminology that is bad for marketing. is why I hate marketing. It just feels dishonest but whatever carb conscious it is. Some items on the menu today are black Angus rib eye steak with broccoli and radishes. Italian sausages and vegetable skewers with two Romeos Mediterranean lemon chicken with baby broccoli, artichokes and olives. Ok. Right now, Sun Basket is offering $35 off your order when you go now. What about later? No, just do it now. I guess they insist to Sun basket.com/lex and enter promo code Lex at checkout again. Visit Sun basket.com/lex and use Code Lex to get $35 off your order. I'm very proud of myself that I avoided a whole long rant about marketing. this was Bill Burr's podcast, this would be a 20 minute rant by how much I hate marketing and brands and strategy. Ok. This episode is also supported by an amazing podcast called Pessimist Archive. They were actually one of the early if not like the first supporter of this podcast. it was honestly just an incredible honor that one of my favorite podcasts would be willing to do this kind of thing. a history show about why people resist new things. Each episode looks at a moment in history when something new was introduced, something that today we think of as commonplace like recorded music, umbrellas, bicycles, cars, chess, coffee, the elevator and the show explores why it freaked everyone out. It blends philosophy and history in a way that often makes me see the world very differently. After listening to an episode, latest episode, for example, brilliantly challenges the assumption that technology made us weaker lazier and dumber by looking at a bunch of examples throughout history. That's the fascinating thing about the show is that stuff that happened long ago, especially in terms of our fear of new things repeats itself in the modern day. And so has many lessons for us to think about in terms of human psychology and the role of tech in our society. Anyway, subscribe and listen to pessimists archive is pessimists.co look in the description please to make sure that the spelling is right or just click the link. I highly recommend this podcast. And now here's my conversation with Avi Loeb. the introduction to your new book Extraterrestrial. You write this book confronts one of the universe's most profound questions. Are we alone over time? This question has been framed in different ways. Is life here on earth? The only life in the universe are humans. The only sentient intelligence in the vastness of space and time. better more precise framing of this question would be this throughout the expanse of space and over the lifetime of the universe. Are there now or have ever been other sentient civilizations that like ours explored the stars and left evidence of their efforts. So let me ask, are we alone?"
