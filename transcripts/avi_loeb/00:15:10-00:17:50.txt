So if you look at us as an example, uh we are now we do have conscious and we do have technology, but the technologies that we are developing are also means for our own destruction. As we can tell, you know, we can change the climate if we are not careful enough, uh we can go into nuclear wars. we are developing means for our own destruction through self inflicted wounds. And it might well be that creatures like us are not long lived that the crocodiles on other planets live for billions of years, they don't destroy themselves, they live naturally. And so if you look around the most common thing would be dumb animals that live for long times, you know, not those that have conscious, but terms of changing the environment, I think since I mean, humans develop tools deve develop uh the ability to construct technologies that would us from this planet that we were born in. And that's something animals without a conscious consciousness cannot really do. And, and so I, you know, in terms of, uh, looking for things that are a new that, that went beyond the circumstances they were born into. would think that even if they're short lived, are the creatures that made the biggest difference to their environment and we can search for them. You know, even if they are short lived and most of the civilizations are dead by now, even if that's the case, that's sad to think about by the way. Well, but if you look on earth that you know, there are lots of cultures that exist throughout time and they are dead by now, the Mayan culture was very sophisticated, died. But we can find evidence for it and learn about it just by archaeology, digging into the ground looking. so we can do the same thing in space, look for dead civilizations. And perhaps we can learn a lesson why they died and behave better so that we will not share the same fate. So I think, you know, there is a lesson to be learned from the sky. by the way, I should also say, if we find the technology that we have not dreamed of that we can import to earth, that may be a better strategy for making a fortune than going to Silicon Valley or going to Wall Street. Because you learn, you, you make a jump, start into something of the future. So that's"
