  "Text": ". So Pascal had this wager about God. And by the way, there are interesting connections between theology the search for extraterrestrial life. You know, it's possible that, you know, we were planted on this planet by another civilization. That's uh you know, we attribute to God powers that are, that belong really to technological civilization. Uh But putting that aside, uh Pascal basically said, you know, let's, there are two possibilities, either God exists or not, right? And if God exists, you know, the consequences are quite significant. therefore, you know, we should, we should consider that possibility differently than equal weight to both possibilities. And then I suggest that we do the same with ou ou or other technological signatures that we uh keep in mind the consequences and therefore pay more attention to that possibility. Now, some people say extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. My point is that the term extraordinary really subjective, you know, for one person, black hole is extraordinary for another. You know, it's just a consequence of Einstein's theory of gravity. Yeah, it's nothing extraordinary. Uh The same about the type of dark matter anything. So we should leave the extraordinary part of that sentence, keep evidence. OK. So let's be guided by evidence. And even even if we have extraordinary claims, you know, let's not dismiss them because the evidence is not extraordinary enough. Because if we have an image of something and it looks really strange and we say, oh, the image is not sufficiently sharp. Therefore, we should not even pay attention to this image or not even consider. I think that's a mistake. What we should do is say, look, there is some evidence for something unusual. try and build instruments that will give us a better image. Uh And if you just dismiss extraordinary claims because that you consider them extraordinary, you avoid discovering things that you haven't expected. And so believe that along the history of astronomy, there are many missed opportunities and I speak about astronomy, but I'm sure in other fields it's also true. I mean, this is my expertise, for example, you know, the Astrophysical journal, which is the main primary publication in in Astrophysics. Uh If you go, you go be be before the 19 eighties, there are images that were posted in the Astrophysical Journal of giant arcs, you know, arcs of light clusters of Galaxies. you know, you can find it in printed versions of the Astrophysical journal. People just ignore, they put the image, they see the art, they say who knows what it is and just ignore it. And then in the 19 eighties, the subject of gravitational lensing became popular and the the idea is that you can deflect light by the force of gravity. And um you can put the source behind the cluster of Galaxies and then you will get these arcs. And actually Einstein predicted it uh in 1940. And you know, so these things were expected but it people just had them in the images didn't pay attention. So I'm sure there are lost opportunities. Sometimes you even in existing data, you have things that are unusual and, and exceptional are not being addressed. Yeah, you"
