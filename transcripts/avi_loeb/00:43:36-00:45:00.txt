  "Text": ". A lot of them. possibility is that these are relay stations. You know that for communication, you might think in order to communicate, you need a huge beacon, a very powerful beacon, but it's not true be even on earth, you know, we have these relay stations so you have not so powerful beacon. So it can be heard only out to a limited distance, but then you relay the message and it could be one of those. Now, after it collided with the the solar system, of course, it got a kick. So it's just like a, a billiard ball, you know, we gave it a kick by colliding with, but most of them are not colliding with stars. And so that's one possibility. Ok. And there should be num lots of them if that's the case. Um uh The other possibility that it's a probe, you know, that was sent in the direction of the um uh habitable region around the sun to find out if there is life. Now, it takes tens of thousands of years for such a probe to traverse the solar system from the outer edge of the old cloud all the way to where we are. you know, it's a long journey. So when it started the journey from the edge of the solar system to get to us, now, you know, we were rather primitive back then. You know, we, we still didn't have any technology. There was no reason to visit, you know, there was grass around and so forth, but, you know, maybe it is a problem. Uh"
