  "Text": "because you have no way to test it. you know, through experiments and experiments really are key it's not just the nuance, you say, OK, forget about experiments. As some philosophers try to say, you know, if there is a consensus, what's the problem? The point is, it's key then that's what Galileo, it's key to have feedback from reality. You know, you can think that you have a billion dollar or that you are more rich than, know, uh Elon Musk. That's fine. You can feel very happy about it. You can talk about it with your friends and all of you will be happy and think about what you can do with the money. Then you go to an ATM machine and you make an experiment, you check how much money you have in, in, in your checking account. if it turns out that, you know, you, you don't have much, you can't, you can't materialize your dreams. OK. So you realize you have a reality check and my point is without experiments giving you a reality check without the ATM machine showing you whether your ideas are bankrupt or not without putting skin in the game and by skin in the game. I mean, don't just talk about theoretical ideas, make them testable. If you don't make them testable, worthless. They are just like theology that is not testable. By the way, theology has some tests. Let me give you, that's interesting three examples. Um turns out that my book already inspired a phd student at Harvard in the English department to pursue a phd in that direction. And, uh, she invited me to the phd exam a couple of months ago. in the exam, one of the examiners, a professor asked her, you know why Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake? And she said, no, I think it's because he was an obnoxious guy and, uh, irritated a lot of people, which is true. the professor said no, it's because Giordano Bruno said that other stars are just like the sun they could have a planet like the earth around them could host life. that was offensive to the church. Why was it offensive? Because there is the possibility that this life sinned?. And if that life sinned on planets around other stars, it should have been saved by Christ and then you need multiple copies of Christ. And that's unacceptable. How can you have duplicates of Christ? And so they burned the guy."
