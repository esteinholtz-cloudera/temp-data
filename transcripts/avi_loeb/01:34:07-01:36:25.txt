  "Text": ", I am involved in a project whose goal is to develop the technology that would allow us to leave the solar system and visit the nearest stars and that is called the stars shot. Uh In 2015, May 2015, um an entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, Yuri Milner came to my office at Harvard and said, um would you be interested leading a project that would do that in our lifetime? Because as we discussed before, to traverse those distances, you know, with existing rockets would take tens of thousands of years. And you know, that's too long, you know, you, you, for example, to get to Proxima Centauri with uh the kind of uh spacecrafts that we already sent like new horizons or uh Voyager one Voyager two,, you need you, you needed to send them when the first humans left Africa. So, so that they would arrive there now and then you know that that's a long time to wait. So you wanted to do it within our lifetime 1020 years, meaning it has to move at a fraction of the speed of light. So can we send a spacecraft that would be moving at a fraction of the speed of light? And said, let me look into that for six months. Um And with my students and postdocs, uh we arrived to the conclusion that the only technology that can do that is the Lightsail technology. Where can you explain it? Uh you basically produce a very powerful laser beam earth so you can collect sunlight uh with uh um photovoltaic cells or whatever and then convert it into uh stored energy and then produce a very powerful laser beam that is 100 gigawatt uh and focus it on a sail in space. That is roughly the size of a person, a couple of meters or a few meters weighs only a gram or a few grams, very thin. through the map, you can show that you can propel such a sail. If you shine on it for a few minutes, it will traverse the distance that is five times the distance to the moon and it will get to 1/5 of the speed of light."
