  "Text": ". No, but you have to understand we think of pollution as a problem. But on a planet that was too cold, for example, to have a comfortable life on it, you can terraforming it and putting a blanket of polluting gasses such that it will be warmer and that would be a positive change. So if uh an industrial or or a technological civilization wants to terraform a planet that otherwise is is too cold for them, they will do it. So what's the problem of defining it as a such goal using the same technologies? problem is that there is a taboo we're not supposed to discuss extraterrestrial intelligence. There is no funding for this subject, not much, very little and young people because of the bullying on Twitter, you know, all all the social media and elsewhere, young people with talent that are curious about this, these questions do not enter this field of study. And obviously, if you step on the grass, will never grow, right? So if you don't give funding,, you know, the mainstream community says, look, nothing was discovered so far, obviously, nothing would be discovered. If talented people go to other disc, never, you never search for it. Well enough, you will never find anything. I mean, look at gravitational wave astrophysics. It's a completely new window into the universe pioneered by Ray Weiss at MIT. And at first, it was ridiculed. And thanks to some administrators at the National Science Foundation, received funding despite the fact that the mainstream of the astronomy community was very resistant. to it. And now it's considered a frontier. So all these people that I remember as a postdoc, a young postdoc, these people that dashed this field and said bad things about people, you know, said nothing will come out of it. they say, oh yeah, of course, you know, the Nobel Prize was given to the, you know, uh to the lack of collaboration. Uh of course, now they are, they are, they are supportive of it. But my point is if, if, if you suppress innovation early on, there are lots of missed opportunities. discovery of exoplanets is one example, you know, in 1952 there was an astronomer called the named the Ostrove. And he wrote a paper saying, why don't we search for Jupiter like planets close to their host star? Because if they're close enough, they would move the star back and forth and we can detect the signal. OK. so astronomers on time allocation committees of telescopes for 40 years argued this is not possible because we know why Jupiter resides so far from the sun, you cannot have Jupiter so close because there is this region where ice forms far from the sun and beyond that region is where Jupiter like planets can form that. There was a theory behind it, which ended up being wrong by now by today's standards. But, they did not give time on telescopes to search for such systems until the first system was discovered four decades after Otto Struve Paper and the Nobel Prize was awarded to that just a couple of years ago. And uh you ask yourself, OK, so, you know, science still made progress. What's the problem? The problem is this baby came out barely, you know, and, and, and there was a delay of four decades. So the progress was delayed and I wonder how many babies were not born because of this resistance. So there must be ideas that are as good as this one that were suppressed because they were bullied because uh people ridiculed them were actually good ideas. And we, these are missed opportunities, babies that were never born. And you know, I'm willing to push this frontier of the search for technologies or technological signatures for civilization. Because, you know, when I was young, I was in the military uh in Israel, it's obligatory to serve. there was this saying that, you know, one of the soldiers sometimes has to put his body on the barbed wire so that others can go through and I'm willing to suffer the pain. So that you know, younger people in the future will be able to speak freely the possibility that some of the anomalies we find in the sky are due to technological signatures."
