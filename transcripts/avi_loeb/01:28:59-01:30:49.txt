  "Text": "I, as I mentioned before, operate by the Copernican principle, meaning that we are not special, we don't live in a special place and not in a special time. And by the way, it's just modesty in scientific terms, right? You're saying I'm not special, you know, I find conditions here, they exist everywhere. So if you adopt the Copernican principle, basically say civilization transmitted radio signals for 100 years roughly. probably it would last another 100 or a few 100 that's it we don't live at a special time. So that's, you know, well, of course, if we get our act together we somehow start to co-operate rather than fighting each other, killing each other, you know, wasting a lot of resources on things that would destroy our planet. we can lengthen that period if we get smarter. But, the, the most natural assumption is to say that we would live into the future as much as we lived from the time that we start to develop the means for our own destruction, the technologies we have, which is quite pessimistic. I must say so several centuries, that's what I would give. Not unless we get our act unless we become more intelligent than the newspapers report every day. OK. Point number one second. And, and by the way, this is relevant, I should say because there was a report about perhaps a radio signal detected from Proxima Centauri. What do you make of that signal? I think it's some Australian guy with a cell phone next to the observatory or something like that because uh was the Parks telescope in Australia. I was like,"
