  "Text": "? So, um it's an interesting uh question because black holes were considered a theoretical construct. Uh And Einstein even denied their existence in 1939. Uh But then um in the 19, in the mid 19 sixties, uh quasars were discovered, these are very bright sources of light uh 100 times brighter than their host galaxy are point like at the uh at the center of Galaxies. And um it was immediately suggested uh by Ed Salter in the West and by Jakov Zel Dovi in the East. Uh that these are black holes that accrete gas, collect gas from their host galaxy that are being fed with gas and they shine very brightly because as the gas falls towards the, the black holes, uh just like water, um, you know, running down the, the sink, uh the gas swirls and then, then rubs against itself and heats up and shines very brightly because it's very hot close to the black hole by viscous by viscosity, it, it, it heats up. And in, in the case of black holes, it's the turbulence, the turbulent viscosity that causes it to heat up. So um we get these very bright sources of light just from black holes that are supposed to be dark, you know, nothing escapes from them, but create a violent environment where gas moves close to the speed of light light and therefore shines very brightly much more than any other source in the sky. And we can see these quasars all the way to the edge of the universe. So we have evidence now that when the universe was, you know, about uh 7% of its present age, you know, infant uh already back then you had black holes of a billion times the mass of the sun, which is quite remarkable, you know, it's like finding babies in a nursery, you know, like uh how can these black holes grow so fast? You know, less than a billion years after the big bang, you already have a billion times the mass of the sun in these black holes. And the answer is presumably there are very quick processes that build them up."
