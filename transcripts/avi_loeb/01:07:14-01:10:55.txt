  "Text": "? Well, it's hard to tell because the Drake Equation is again quantifying our ignorance. It just a set of factors. The only one that we know or actually true that we know quite well is the rate of star formation in the milky way galaxy which we measured by now the frequency of planets like the earth around stars and the at the right distance to have life. But other than that, there are lots of implicit assumptions about all the other factors that will enable us to detect the signal. Now, I should say the Drake Equation has a very limited validity just for signals from civilizations that are transmitting at the time that you're observing them. However,, we can do much better than that. We can look for that they left behind, even even if they are dead, you can look for industrial pollution in the atmosphere of planet. Uh Why do I bring this up again to show you the conservatism of the mainstream in astronomy? And by the way, I shouldn't, you know, I have leadership positions I, I was chair of the astronomy Department for nine years, the longest serving chair at Harvard. And I'm the chair of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies. You know, it's a primary uh board. And, um you know, I'm director of two centers at Harvard and so forth. So II, I do represent the community in, in various ways, but at the same time, you know, I'm a little bit disappointed by the conservatism that people have. And so let me give you an illustration of that. So the astronomy community is going right now through the process of defining its goals for the next decade. And there are proposals for telescopes that would cost billions of dollars. whose goal is to find evidence for oxygen in the atmosphere of planets around other stars. With the idea that this would be marker, a signature of life. Now, the problem with that is earth didn't have much oxygen in its atmosphere for the 1st 2 billion years, roughly half of, you know, half of its life, it didn't have much oxygen, but it had life, it had microbial life. It's not an it's not clear yet as of yet what the origin is for the rise in the oxygen level after 2 billion years, about 2.4 billion years ago. But we know that a planet can have life without oxygen in the atmosphere because earth did it, the second problem with this approach is that you can have oxygen from natural processes, you can break uh water molecules and make oxygen. So even if you find it, it will never tell you that for sure life exists there. And so even with these billions of dollars, the mainstream community never be confident uh whether there is life there. Now, how can it be confident there is actually a way if instead of looking with the same instruments, if you look for molecules that indicate industrial pollution, for example, CF CS, you know, that are produced by refrigerating systems or industries here on earth, they do the ozone layer, you know, you can search for that and I wrote a paper five years ago suggesting that now what's the problem? You can just tell NASA, I want to build this telescope to search for oxygen, but also for industrial pollution. Nobody would say that because it sounds like, know, on the periphery of the field. And I ask you why"
