So imagine what would happen in 100 years in 1000 years, in a million years, or in a billion years. Now, the sun is actually late in the star formation history of the universe. Most of the sun like stars formed earlier and some of them already died, you know, became white dwarfs. And um if you imagine that a civilization like ours existed around a typical sun like star by now, if they survive, they could be a billion years old and then imagine a billionaire technology, it would look like magic to us. It, you know, an approximation to God, we wouldn't be able to understand it.

If, if, if you are inferior, there is a risk, if you speak too loudly, something bad may happen to"
