  "Text": "that ridiculous. I take the next step. It's ridiculous for another reason, not because of just the scientific benefits that we might have by exploring it, but because the public cares about these questions and the public funds science. So how dare the scientists shy away from addressing these questions if they have the technology to do it? like saying, I don't want to look through Galileo's telescope. It's exactly the same. You have the technology to explore this question, to find the evidence and you shy away from it. You might ask why do people shy away from it? And perhaps it's because of the fact that there is science fiction. I, I'm not a fan of science fiction because it has an element to it that violates the laws of physics in many of the books and, and, and the film and I cannot enjoy the these things when I see the laws of physics violated. who cares that the, you know, the fact that there is science fiction, I mean, if, if you have the scientific methodology to address the same subject, I don't care that other people uh you know, spoke nonsense about this subject or said things that make no sense. Who cares? You do your scientific work just like you explore the dark matter. You explore the possibility that Umu AUA is an artifact, you just look for evidence and try to deduce uh what, what it means. Um And I have no problem with doing that Uh To me, it sounds like any other scientific question that we have and given the public's interest, we have an obligation to do that. By the way, science to me is not an occupation of the elite. It doesn't allow me to feel superior to other humans that are unable to understand the math. me, it's a, it's a way of life. You know, if, if there is a problem in the faucet or in the pipe, uh, at home, I try to figure out what the problem is and with a plumber, we figure it out and, you know, we look at the clues and the same thing in science. You know, you, you look at the evidence, you try to figure out what it means. It's, it's common sense in a way and, uh, uh, it shouldn't be regarded as something removed from the public. It should be a reflection of the public's interest. I think it's actually a crime to resist the public. If the public says I care about this and you say no, no, no, that's not sophisticated enough for me. I want to do intellectual gymnastics on anti sitter space. To me. That's a crime. Yes."
