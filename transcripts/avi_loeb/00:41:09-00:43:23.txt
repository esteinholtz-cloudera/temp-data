  "Text": "excellent question. And let me lay out, I mean, we don't have enough evidence to tell if we had a photograph, perhaps we would have more information. But the possi there is one other peculiar fact about Umama. well, other than it was very shiny, I that I didn't mention uh you know, we didn't detect any heat from it. And that implies that it's rather small and shiny. Uh But the other peculiar fact is that it was, it came from a very special frame of reference. So it's sort of like finding a car in a parking lot in a public parking lot that, you know, you can't really tell where it came from. So there is this frame of reference where you average over the motions of all the stars in the neighborhood of the sun. So um you find the so called local standard of rest of the galaxy and that's uh a frame of reference that is obtained by averaging the random motions of all the stars and the sun is moving relative to that frame at some speed. Uh But this object was at rest in that frame only one in 500 stars is so much at rest in that frame. And that's why I was saying it's like a parking, it was parked there and we bumped into it. So the relative speed between the solar system and this object is just because we are moving, was sitting still. Now, you ask yourself, why is it so unusual in that context? You know why? Because if it was expelled from another planetary system, most likely it will carry the speed of the host star that it came from because it was, you know, the most loosely bound objects are in the periphery of the planetary system and move very slowly relative to the star. And so they carry the, when they are ripped apart from the planetary system, most of the objects will have the residual motion of the star rough relative to the local star. But this one was interesting the locust. Now, one thing I can think of if, if there is a grid of uh road posts, you know, like for navigation system that you can find your way in the local frame, then that would be one,"
