  "Text": ", just a rock. So when you have ice on the surface, the rock gets close to the sun, the sunlight warms it up and the, the ice sublimates evaporates because the one thing about ice, water ice is it doesn't become liquid. If you warm it up in vacuum, you know, without an external pressure, it just goes straight into gas. And that's what you see as the tail of a comet. only way to get liquid water is to have an atmosphere like on earth that has an external pressure only then you get liquid and that's why it's essential to have an atmosphere to a planet in order to have liquid water and the chemistry of life. So if you look at Mars, Mars lost its atmosphere and therefore no liquid water on the surface anymore, I mean, there may have been early and that's what the perseverance survey, you know, uh the perseverance mission will, will try to find out whether it had liquid water, whether there was life perhaps on it at the time. But at some point, it lost its atmosphere and then the liquid water was gone. So the only reason that we can live on earth is because of the atmosphere, but a comet is in vacuum pretty much. And then when it gets warmed up on the surface, the water becomes the water ice gas. And then you see this cometary tail behind it. In addition to water, there is uh there are all kinds of carbon based molecules or dust that comes off the surface and not detectable. So it's easy to detect. It's very prominent. You see these cometary tail that look very prominent because they reflect sunlight and you can see them. In fact, it's sometimes difficult to see the nucleus of the comet because it's surrounded and shrouded with. And in this case, was no trace of anything. Now, you might say, OK, it's not a com so that's what the community said. OK. It's not a no problem. It's still a rock, you know, it's not a comet, but it's just a rock. Bare rock, you know. OK, no problem then. And that's the thing that convinced me to write about it. And then in June 2018, you know, significantly later, was a report that in fact, the object uh exhibited an excess push in addition to the force of gravity. So the sun acts on it by gravity. But then there was an extra push on this object that was figured out from the orbit that you can trace. And the question was, what is this excess push? So for comets, you get the rocket effect. When you evaporate gas, know, just like a jet engine on an airplane, you throw a jet engine is very simple. You throw the gas back and it pushes the airplane forward. That's all that's how a jet. So in a case of a comet, you throw gas in the direction of the sun because it, and then you get a push. Ok. So in the case of comets, you can get a push, but there was no cometary tale. So then people say, oh wait a second. it an asteroid? No, but it behaves like a comet but it doesn't look like a comet. So what, well, forget about it business as usual."
