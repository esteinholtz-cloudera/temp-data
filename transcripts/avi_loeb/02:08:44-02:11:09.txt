  "Text": "2017 was given for the Ligo collaboration for discovering gravitational waves from collisions of black holes. then the 2020 Nobel Prize in physics was given for uh two things. One was theoretical work that was done by Roger Penrose in the 19 sixties demonstrating that black holes are inevitable when uh stars collapse. And then it was mostly mathematical work. And actually Stephen Hawking uh also contributed significantly to that frontier and unfortunately, he is not alive, so he could not be honored. So Penrose received it on his own. Um And then uh two other astronomers received it as well. Uh Andrea Guez and Reinhard Genzel and they provided conclusive evidence that there is a black hole at the center of the Milky way galaxy uh that weighs about 4 million times the mass of the sun. they found the evidence from the motion of stars very close to the black hole, just like we see the planets moving around the sun. There are stars close to the center of the galaxy and they are orbiting at very high speeds of other thousands of kilometers per second or thousands of miles per second per second. Uh Think about it, uh which uh can only be induced at those distances if there is a 4 million mass object that is extremely compact. And the only thing that is compatible with the constraints is a black hole. And then uh they actually made a movie of the motion of these stars around the center. Uh One of them moves around the center over a decade, you know, six over time scales that we can monitor. And um it was a breakthrough in a way. Um So combining Ligo with uh the detection of a black hole at the center of the milky way and, and in many other Galaxies like quasars, uh you know, now, now, uh I would say uh black hole research is vogue, you know, it's, it's very much in fashion, you know, we saw it back in 2016 when we established the black hole initiative, you"
