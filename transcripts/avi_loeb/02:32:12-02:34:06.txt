  "Text": "most of the community believes that it's a particle we haven't yet detected, it doesn't interact with light, so it's dark. But then the question is what does it interact with? And how can we find it? And then for many years, uh physicists were guided by the idea that it's some extension of the standard model of particle physics. But then they said, oh, we will find some clues from the large Hadron Collider about its nature maybe it's related to super symmetry, which is a new symmetry that we haven't found any evidence for. In both cases, the large Hadron Collider did not give us any clues. And other people search for specific types of particles in the laboratory and didn't find any uh a couple of years ago, actually, around the time that I worked on Umu AUA, I also worked on the possibility that the dark matter particles may have a small electric charge, which is a speculation, nobody complained about it. And you know, it was published and I regarded more as of speculation than the artificial origin of Umama. And then to me, apply, you know, as far as I'm concerned, I applied the same scientific tools. In both cases, there is an anomaly that led me to that discussion, which has to do with the hydrogen being called in the early universe more than we expected. So we suggested maybe the dark matter particles have some small charge, but then you deal with anomalies by exploring possibilities. That's the only way to do it and then collecting more data to check those and searching for uh technological signatures. Uh is the same as any other part of scientific endeavor. We make hypothesis and we collect data and I don't see any reason for having a taboo on this subject"
