  "Text": "could be that the dark matter is made of black holes of this mass? You know, we don't know what the dark matter is made of. You could it could be uh black holes. So we said, but there is an experimental way to test it the way to do. It is because uh is there is the old cloud of icy rocks in the outer solar system. And if you imagine a black hole there, um every now and then a rock will pass close enough to the black hole to be disrupted by the very strong gravity close to the black hole. And that would produce a flare you can observe. And we calculated how frequently these flares should occur. And with LSST on the Vera Rubin Observatory, we found that you can actually test this hypothesis. And if you don't see flares, then you can put limits on the existence of a black hole in the solar system. would be extremely exciting if there was a black hole, if planet nine was a black hole because we could visit it, you know, and we can examine it. Um And it will not be a matter of um you know, an object that is very removed from us. Another thing I should say is it's possible that the black hole affected life on earth. the black hole at the center of the milky way um you know that black hole right now is dormant. It's very faint, but we know that it flares when a star like the sun comes close to it. Uh the star will be spaghetti fight basically become a stream of gas like a spaghetti and then the gas would fall into the black hole and there would be a flare and this process happens once every 10,000 years or so. So we expect that, you know, these flares to occur every 10,000 years. we also see evidence for the possibility that gas clouds were disrupted by the black hole because the the stars that are close to the black hole are residing in a single or two planes. And the only way you can get that is if they formed out of a disc of gas, just like the planets in the solar system formed. So there is evidence that gas fell into the black hole and powered possibly a flare. And flares produce x rays and ultraviolet radiation that could damage life. If, if the earth was close enough to the center of the galaxy we are right now, it's not very risky for us. But there is a a theoretical argument that says the solar system, the sun was closer to the galactic center early on and then it migrated outwards. So maybe, maybe in the early stage of the solar system, the conditions, know, were affected, shaped by these flares of the black hole descent of the galaxy. And that's why for the 1st 2 billion years, there wasn't any oxygen in the atmosphere, you know, who knows? But um it's just interesting to think that, you know, from a theoretical concept that Einstein resisted in 1939 may well be that, you know, uh black holes have influence on our life and that, you know, it's just like discovering that some uh uh stranger affected your family in a way your life and then, you know, if that happens to be the case, a second Nobel prize should be given not, not for just the discovery of this black hole descent of the galaxy, but perhaps for the Nobel Prize in chemistry for the effect that it had for"
