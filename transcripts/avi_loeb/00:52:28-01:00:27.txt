  "Text": ". So I think when we see something like that, we would be shocked not to speak about seeing technology now. So I, I don't even dare to imagine, you know, and I think, you know, obviously we can bury our head in the sand and say it's never aliens, like many of my colleagues say, it's a self fulfilling prophecy. If you, if you never look, you will never find, if you're not ready to find wonderful things, you will never discover them. And the other thing I would like to say is, doesn't care whether you ignore it or not, you can ignore reality, but it's still there. So we can all agree based on Twitter, that aliens don't exist. That Umu AUA was a rock. We can all agree and you will get a lot of likes, you have a big crowd of supporters and everyone will be happy and give each other awards and honors and so forth. um Mua might still be an alien art, who cares what humans agree on. There is a reality out there and we have to be modest enough to recognize that we should make our statements based on evidence. Science is not about ourselves, it's not about glorifying our image. not about getting honors prizes. You know, a lot of the scientific, a lot of the academic activity is geared towards creating your echo chamber where you have students, postdocs repeating your mantras so that your voice is heard loudly so that you can get more honors prizes, recognition. not the purpose of science. The purpose is to figure out what nature is, right? And in the process of doing that, it's a learning experience, you make mistakes. You know, Einstein made three mistakes. At the end of his career, he argued that in the 19 thirties, he argued that black holes don't exist, gravitational waves don't exist and quantum mechanics doesn't have action at a distance and all three turned out to be wrong. OK. So the point is that if you work at the frontier of then you make mistakes, it's inevitable because you can tell what is true or not. And avoiding making mistakes in order to preserve your image makes you extremely boring. Ok? You will get a prize, but you will be a boring scientist because you will keep repeating things. We already know. If you want to make progress. If you want to innovate, have to take risks and you have to look at the evidence. It's a dialogue with nature. You don't know the, the truth in advance. You let nature tell you educate you then you, you realize that what you thought before is incorrect. And a lot of my colleagues prefer to be in a state where they have a monologue. You know, if you look at these people that work on string theory, uh they have a monologue, they know what and in fact, their monologue is centered on anti deer space which we don't live in now. know, it's, to me, it's just like the Olympics. You know, you, you define 100 m and you say whoever runs this 100 m is the best athlete the fastest, you know, and then it's completely arbitrary. You could have decided it would be 50 m or 20 m. Who cares? You just measure the ability of people this way. So you define anti theta space as a space where you do your mathematical gymnastics and then you find who can do it the best. And you give jobs based on that, you give prizes best. as we said before, you know, nature doesn't care about, you know, the prizes that you give to each other, it cares, you know, it has its own reality and we should figure it out. And it's not about us. The scientific activity is about figuring out nature and sometimes we may be wrong. Our image will not be preserved. But, that's the fun. You know, I um kids explore the world out of curiosity and I always want to maintain my childhood curiosity and I don't care about the labels that I have. In fact, having tenure is, is exactly the opportunity to behave like a child because you can make mistakes. And was asked by the Harvard gazette, you know, the, the, the Pravda of Harvard. Uh what, what is the one thing that you would like to change about the world? And I said I would like my colleagues to behave more like kids. That's the one thing I would like them to do because something happens to these kids when they become tenured professors, they start to worry about their ego and about themselves more than about the purpose of science, which is, you know, curiosity driven, figuring out from evidence, evidence is the key. So when an object shows anomalies, like, um what's the problem discussing, you know, whether it's artificial or not? You know. So there was, I should tell you there was a mainstream paper in nature published saying it must be natural. it, it's unusual, but it must be natural period. And then at the same time, uh that those main, some other mainstream scientists tried to explain the properties and they came up with interpretations like it's a dust bunny, you know, the kind that you find in a household, a collection of dust particles pushed by sunlight, we have never seen before or it's a hydrogen iceberg. It actually evaporates like a comet, but hydrogen is transparent, you don't see it. And that's why we don't see the cometary ta again, we have never seen something like that. In both cases, the objects would not survive the the long journey. We, we discussed it in a paper that I wrote afterwards. But my point is those that try to explain the unusual properties into great length at discussing things that we have never seen before. Ok. So even when you think about the natural origin, you have to come up with scenarios that of things that were never seen before. Uh And by the way, they look less plausible to me personally. But my point is if we discuss things that were never seen before, right? Why not discuss, why not contemplate an artificial origin? What's the problem? Why do people have this back? Uh you know, I worked on on dark matter and then we don't know what most of the matter in the universe is. It's called dark matter it's just an acronym because we have no clue, we simply don't know. So it could be all kinds of particles. And over the years, people suggested weakly interacting massive particles axions, all kinds of particles and experiments were made, they cost hundreds of millions of dollars. put upper limits constraints that ruled out many of the possibilities that were proposed as natural. Initially, the mainstream community regarded it as a mainstream activity to search the nature of the dark matter they nobody complained that it's speculative to consider weakly interacting massive particles., I ask you why is it speculative to consider extraterrestrial technologies? We have a proof that it exists here on earth. We also know that the conditions of of of earth are reproduced in billions of systems throughout the milky way galaxy. what's more conservative than to say if you arrange for similar conditions, you get the same outcome. How can you imagine this to be spec it's not speculative at all and nevertheless, it's regarded the periphery. And at the same time, you have physicists theoretical physics working on extra dimensions, super symmetry, super string theory, the multiverse, maybe we live in a simulation, all of these ideas that have no grounding in reality. Some of which sound to me like, you know, just like what someone would say uh science"
