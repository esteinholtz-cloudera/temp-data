  "Text": ", you know, people afterwards say, ok, you work on this project, you imagine the, know, that's a pretty good explanation. Obviously, my imagination is limited by what I know. So I, you know, I would not deny that, you know, working on light sales expanded my ability to imagine this possibility. But let me offer another interesting anecdote in September this year 2020 I mean, 2020. Um there was another object found it was given the name 2020. So by the minor Planet center, you know, this is an organization actually in Cambridge Massachusetts that gives names to objects astronomical objects found in the solar system. And they gave it that name 2020 0 because you know, it looked like uh an object in the solar system and uh it moved in an orbit that is similar to the orbit of the earth, but not the same. Exactly. therefore it was bound to the sun, but it also exhibited a deviation from what you expect based on gravity. So the astronomers that found it uh extrapolated back in time and found that in 1966 it intercepted the earth. And then they realized they went to the history books and they realized, oh, there was a mission called Lunar Surveyor, Lunar Lander two that uh had a rocket booster. It was a failed mission, but uh there was a rocket booster that was kicked into space. And presumably this is the rocket booster that we're seeing. Now. This rocket booster was sufficiently hollow and thin for us to recognize that it's pushed by sunlight. So here is my point. We can tell from the orbit of an object. Obviously, this object didn't have any cometary tail. was artificially made, we know that it was made by us and it did deviate from an orbit of a rock. So just by seeing something that doesn't have cometary tail and deviates from an orbit shaped by gravity, we can tell that it's art the case of Umu AUA, it couldn't have been sent by humans because it just passed near us for a few months. We know exactly what we were doing at those at that time and also it was moving, moving faster than any object that we can launch. And so obviously, it came from outside the solar system and the question is who produced it? Now, I should say that, you know, when I walk on, on vacation on the beach, I often see natural like seashells that are beautiful and I look at them and um and every now and then I stumble on a plastic bottle the that was artificially produced. my point is that maybe Omu AUA was a message in a bottle. And the we should s this is simply another window into searching for artifacts from other civilizations."
