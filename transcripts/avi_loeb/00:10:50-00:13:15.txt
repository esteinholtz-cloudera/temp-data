  "Text": "an excellent question. Uh For me, the answer is of clear because I start from the principle of modesty. You know, if we believe that we are alone and special and unique that shows organs, my daughters, when they were infants, they tended to think that they are special, unique. And then they went out to the street realize that other kids are very much like them and, and then they develop the sense of a better perspective about themselves. And I think the only reason that we are still thinking that we are special is because we haven't search well enough to find others that might even be better than us. Uh, and, um, you know, I say that because I look at the newspaper every morning and I that we do foolish things. We are not necessarily the most intelligent ones. And if you think about it, if you open a recipe book, you see that out of the same ingredients, you can make very different cakes depending on how you put them together and how you heat them up. And, uh, what is the chance that by taking the soup of chemicals that existed on earth? And cooking way to get our life that uh you got the best cake possible. I mean, we are probably not the sharpest cookie in the jar. And, uh my question is, uh, I mean, it's pretty obvious to me that we are probably not alone because half of all the sun like stars we know now as astronomers, half of the sun like stars from the Kepler satellite data have a planet, uh the size of the earth roughly at the same distance that the earth is from the sun. that means that they can have liquid water on their surface and the chemistry of life as we know it. So if you roll the dice billions of times just within the milky way galaxy then you have tens of billions of Galaxies like it within the observable volume of the universe. It would be extremely arrogant to think that we are special. I would think that we are sort of middle of the road, typical forms of life. And that's why they, nobody pays attention to us. You know, if you go down the street on the sidewalk and you see an ant, you don't pay attention or a special respect to that ant, you just continue to walk. And so I think that we are average, not very interesting, not exciting. So nobody cares about us. We tend to think that we are special, but that's a sign of"
