  "Text": "100% agree. So, it's, it's hilarious. That's a very, hilarious. It's sad that people who are trained in the scientific community to have the tools to explore this world, to be Children, to be the most effective at being Children are the ones that resist being Children the most. But there is a large number of people that embrace the childlike wonder about the world and may not necessarily have the tools to do it. That's the more general public. so, you know, I wonder if I could ask you and talk to you a little bit about UFO sightings that there's people, know, quote unquote believers, there's hundreds of thousands of UFO sightings and, know, I've consumed some of the things that people have said about it. And one thing I really like about it is how excited they are by the possibility by it's almost like this childlike wonder about the world out there. It's not a fear, it's an excitement. Do you think because we're talking about this possibly extraterrestrial object that visited that flew by earth? Do you think it's possible that out of those hundreds of thousands of UFO sightings, an actual one or some number is an actual sighting of a nonhuman, some alien technology and that we're not, we did not, we too close minded uh to look and to see,"
