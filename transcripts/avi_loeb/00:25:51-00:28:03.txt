  "Text": "ours. And so the actual detection of this one was surprising by itself to me. And then, but then so at first they thought maybe it's a comet or an asteroid, but then it didn't look like anything we've seen before did look like a comet. So people asked me afterwards and said, you know, doesn't it convince you if Borisov looks like a comet, doesn't it convince you that UMA Mua is also natural? And I said, you know, when I went on the first date with my wife, uh she looked special to me. And since then I met many women that didn't change my opinion of my wife. So, you know, that's not an argument anyway. So why did, did the omu AUA look weird? Let me explain. So first of all, astronomers monitored the amount of light sunlight that it reflects and uh it was tumbling, spinning eight hours. And as it was spinning, the brightness that we saw from that direction, we couldn't resolve it because it's tiny. It's about 100 m a few 100 ft size of a football field. And then we cannot from earth with existing telescopes, we cannot resolve it. The only way to actually get a photograph of it is to send a camera close to it. And that was not possible at the time the mua was discovered because it was already moving away from us faster than any rocket we can send. It's sort of like a guest that appeared for dinner. And then by the time we realize that it's weird, uh the guest is already out the front door into the dark street. Uh What we would like to find is an object like it approaching us because then you can send the camera irrespective of how fast it moves. And uh if we were to find it in July 2017, would have been possible because it was approaching us at that time. Actually, I was visiting Mount Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii with my family for vacation at that time in July 2017, but nobody knew at the observatory that um is very close."
