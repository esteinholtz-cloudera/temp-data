  "Text": "think it's very different than we can imagine. Uh By the way, I should start from the point that even biological life, you know, just, uh without technology getting into the game, uh could look like something we have never seen before. Uh, take, for example, the nearest star which is Proxima Centauri, it's four and a quarter light years away. they will know about the results of the 2016 elections only next month in February 2021. Um It's very far away. Um But um if you think about it, um know, this, this uh star is a, is a dwarf star and uh it's much cooler than I it's uh twice as cold as the sun. OK. And it emits mostly infrared radiation. So if there are any creatures on the planet close to it, that is habitable, which is called Proxima B. There is a planet in the habitable zone in the zone just at the right distance where in principle, liquid water can be on the surface. If there are any animals there, they have infrared eyes because our eyes was designed to be sensitive to where most of the sunlight is in the visible range. But Proxima Centarium its mostly infrared. So you know, the nearest to see each other in the nearest star system, these animals would be quite strange. They would have eyes that are detectors of infrared very different from ours. Moreover, this planet Proxima B faces the star always with the same side. So it has a permanent day side and a permanent night side. the obviously the creatures that would evolve on the permanent day side, which is much warmer would be quite different than those on the permanent night side. Between them, there would be a permanent sunset strip. And my daughters said that that's the best opportunity for high value real estate because you will see the sunset your life, right? It the sun never sets on this, on this trip. So, you know, these worlds are out of our imagination,"
