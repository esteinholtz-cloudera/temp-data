  "Text": "it's not even written in Alfred Nobel's will. It turns out one of our teammates looked into it a museum in Stockholm. When we went there for Nobel Week in 2011, the the leaders who got the prize formally knew that without the rest of us working hard in the trenches, the result would not have, you know, been discovered. So they invited us to participate in Nobel Week. And so one of the team members looked in the will and it's not there. It's just tradition, it's archaic, you know, that's the way science used to be done it's not the way a lot of science is done now and you look at gravitational wave discovery, which was, you know, recognized with the Nobel Prize in 2017 Ray Weiss at MIT, got it and Kip Thorne and um, and um Barry Barish at Caltech and Ron Dreaver, one of the masterminds had, had passed away earlier in the year. So again, of the rules of Nobel is that it's not given posthumously, or at least the one exception might be if they've made their decision and they're busy making their press releases right before October the first week in October or whatever, and then the person passes away, I think they don't change their minds then. But yeah, you know, it, it, doesn't square with today's reality that a lot of science is done by big teams. In that case, a team of 1000 people in our case, it was two teams consisting of about 50 people. And we used techniques that were arguably developed in part by people who who weren't even on those two papers. I mean, some of them were, but other papers were written by by other people, you know, and so it's like we're standing on the shoulders of giants and none of those people was officially recognized. And to me, it was OK, you know, again, it was the thrill of doing the work. And ultimately, the work with the discovery was recognized with the prize. And, you know, we got to participate in Nobel week. And, know, it, it's ok with me. I, I've known other physicists whose lives were ruined because they did not get the Nobel Prize and they felt strongly that they should have Ralph Alpher um of the alpha beta gamma, you know, paper predicting the microwave background radiation. He should have gotten it. His advisor Goff was dead by that point. But, um, you know, Penzias and Wilson got it for the discovery and, Alpher apparently from colleagues who knew him well, I've talked to them. His life was ruined by this. He just, he just gnawed at his innards so much."
