  "Text": ", I mean, you know, if you very difficult to answer right now because we don't have a single verified, fully self consistent experimentally tested quantum theory of gravity. And of course, the beginning of the universe is a large amount of stuff in a very small space. So you need both quantum mechanics and general relativity. Same thing if our universe rec collapses and then bounces back to another Big Bang. You know, there's also ideas there that some of the information leaks through or survives. I don't know that we can answer that question right now because we don't have a quantum theory of gravity that most physicists uh believe in and belief is perhaps the wrong word that most physicists trust because the experimental evidence favors it. Right. You know, there are various forms of string theory, there's quantum loop gravity, there are various ideas but which if any will be the one that survives the test of time. And more importantly that the test of experiment and observation. So my own feeling is probably these things don't survive. I don't think we've seen any evidence in the cosmic microwave background radiation of, of information leaking through. Similarly. Um The one way or one of the few ways in which we might test for the presence of other universes is if they were to collide with ours, that would leave a, a pattern, a temperature signature in the cosmic microwave background radiation. astrophysicists claim to have found it, but in my opinion, it's not statistically significant the level that would be necessary to have such a, an amazing claim, right? You know, it's just a 5% chance that the microwave background had that distribution just by chance, 5% isn't very long odds if you're claiming that instead that you're that you're finding, you know, evidence from another universe. I mean, it's like if the large Hadron Collider people had claimed gathering enough data to show the Higgs particle when there was a 5% chance it could be just a sta statistical fluctuation in their data. No, they, they required five S sigma five standard deviations which is roughly one chance in 2 million that this is a statistical fluctuation of no physical significance."
