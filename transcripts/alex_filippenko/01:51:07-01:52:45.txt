  "Text": "the accelerating universe is simply that we look at the Galaxies moving away from us right now, we would expect them to be moving away more slowly than they were billions of years ago. And that's because Galaxies have visible matter which is gravitationally attractive and dark matter of an unknown sort that holds Galaxies together and holds clusters of Galaxies together. And of course, they then pull on one another they would tend to retard the expansion of the universe. Just as when I toss an apple up, you know, even ignoring air resistance, the mutual gravitational attraction between earth and the apple slows the apple down. And if that attraction is great enough, then the apple will someday stop and even come back, the big crunch, you could call it or the gab G which is big bang backwards, right? That's what could have happened to the universe. But even if the universe's original expansion energy was so great it avoids the big crunch that's like an apple thrown at earth's escape speed. It's like the the the the the rockets that go to Mars someday, right? You know, uh with people even then you'd expect the universe to be slowing down with time. But we looked back through the history of the universe by looking at progressively more distant Galaxies by seeing that the of this expansion rate is that in the 1st 9 billion years, yeah, it was slowing down, but in the last 5 billion years, it's been speeding up. So who asked for that? Right. You know, um"
