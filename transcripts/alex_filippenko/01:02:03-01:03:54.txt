  "Text": "galaxy, our milky way galaxy with several 100 billion and, and potentially habitable planets is not teeming with intelligent life. Yeah, I wouldn't. Well, I'll get to the primitive life, the bacteria in a moment. But um know, we, we may well be the only ones in our milky way galaxy at most, a handful I'd say, but I'd probably side with the school of thought that suggests we're the only ones in our own galaxy because I don't see human intelligence as being a, a natural evolutionary path for life. Um I mean, there's a, there's a number of arguments, first of all, there's been more than 10 billion species of life on earth in its history. Uh Nothing has approached our level of intelligence and mechanical ability and curiosity, you know, whales and dolphins appear to be reasonably intelligent, there's no evidence that they can think abstract thoughts that they're curious about the world. They certainly can't build machines with which to study the world. Um So that's one argument. Secondly, came about as early hominids only four or 5 million years ago. And as ho homo sapiens only about a quarter of a million years ago. So for the vast majority of the history of life on earth, an intelligent alien zipping by earth would have said there's nothing particularly intelligent or mechanically able on earth. Ok. Thirdly, it's not clear that our intelligence is a long term advantage. Now, it's clear that in the last 100 years, 200 years, we've improved the lives of millions, hundreds of millions of people. But at the risk of po po potentially destroying ourselves either intentionally or unintentionally or through neglect as we discussed before."
