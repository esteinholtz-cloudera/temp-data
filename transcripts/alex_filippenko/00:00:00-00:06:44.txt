  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Alex Filipenko, an astrophysicist and professor of astronomy from Berkeley. He was a member of both the supernova Cosmology project and the high Z supernova search team which used observations of the extragalactic supernova to discover that the universe is accelerating and that this implies the existence of dark energy. This discovery resulted in the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics of his groundbreaking research. He is a great science communicator and is one of the most widely admired educators in the world. I really enjoyed this conversation and I'm sure Alex will be back again in the future. mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts related to the episode,, the maker of functional sugar free gum and mints that I used to give my brain a quick caffeine boost, help and online therapy with a licensed professional master class, online courses that I enjoy from some of the most amazing humans in history and cash app. The app I use to send money to friends.

As a side note, let me say that as we talk about in this conversation, objects that populate the universe are both awe inspiring and terrifying in their capacity to create and to destroy us. flares and asteroids lurking in the darkness of space threaten our humble fragile existence here on earth. In the chaos, tension, conflict and social division of 2020. It's easy to forget just how lucky we humans are to be here and with a bit of hard work, maybe one day we'll venture out towards the stars. you enjoy this thing, subscribe on youtube review with five stars on Apple podcast.

It's loved by Olympians and engineers alike. I personally love the mint gum. It helps me focus during times when I can use a boost. My favorite to use cases are before a long run and also in the morning at the start of a deep work session me, it's really important to get that 1st 10 to 20 minutes off to a great start. That's when the desire to think about and check on the stresses of the previous day is strongest. But I think that's when it's most important to calm the mind and focus on the task at hand., two pieces of Nero gum has one cup of coffee's worth of caffeine.
