  "Text": "was quite a character. Uh and one of the deepest thinkers of all time probably and at least in my life, the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding of how nature works of anyone I've met. he I learned a number of things from him. He was not my thesis advisor. I worked with Wallace sergeant at Caltech on what are called active Galaxies, big black holes in the centers of Galaxies that are accreting or swallowing material a little bit like the stuff of, of this year's Nobel Prize in physics 2020. Uh but Feynman, I had for, for two courses, one was General theory of relativity at the graduate level and one was applications of quantum physics to all kinds of interesting things. he, you know, he had this very intuitive way of, of looking at things that he tried to, he tried to bring to his students. And he felt that you can't explain something in a reasonably simple way a non scientist, at least, uh you know, someone who is versed a little bit with science but is not a professional scientist, then you probably don't understand it very well yourself very thoroughly. So that in me, um know, made a desire to, to, to be able to explain science to the, to the general public. And I've often found that in explaining things. Yeah, there's a certain part that I didn't really understand myself. That's one reason I like to teach the introductory courses to the lay public is that I sometimes find that my explanations are lacking in my own mind, you know, so he did that for"
