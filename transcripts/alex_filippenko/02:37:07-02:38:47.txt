  "Text": "magnificent. Needn't have been that way.. And this is one of the, you know, the multiverse sort of things, you know, you can alter the laws of physics or, or even the cons of nature, seemingly inconsequential things like the mass ratio of the proton and the neutron, you know, wake me up when it's over. Right. What could be more boring? But it turns out you play with things a little bit like the ratio of the mass of the neutron to the proton you generally get boring universes, only hydrogen or only helium or only iron. You don't even get the rich periodic table, let alone bacteria, paramecia slugs and humans. Ok. I'm not even anthropomorphic anthropocentrism this to the degree that I could even a rich periodic table wouldn't be if, if certain constants weren't this way. But, but they are, and that to me leads to the idea of, of a multiverse that, you know, that the dice were thrown many, many times. And there's this cosmic archipelago where most of the universes are, are boring and some might be more interesting. But we are in the rare breed. That's really quite darn interesting. And if there were only one and maybe there is only one, well, then that's, that's truly amazing. lucky. We're lucky. But I actually think there are lots and loss just like there are lots of planets. Earth isn't special for any particular reason. There are lots of planets in our solar system and especially around other stars. And occasionally there are gonna be ones that are conducive to the development of complexity culminating in life as we know it. And that's a beautiful story."
