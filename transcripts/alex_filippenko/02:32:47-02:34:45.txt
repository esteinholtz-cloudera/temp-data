  "Text": ", you know, life is what you make of it really, right? It's um of us has to have our own meaning and, it doesn't have to be., I I think that in, in many cases, meaning is, is to some degree associated with goals, you set some goals or expectations for yourself, things you want to accomplish things you wanna do, um things you want to experience and to the degree that you experience those and do those things. It can give you meaning. don't have to change the world the way Newton or Michelangelo or Da Vinci did I mean, people often say you change the world but look, come on, there's 7.5, close to 8 billion of us. Now, most of us are not going to change the world. And does that mean that most of us are leading meaningful lives? No, it, it just has to be something that gives you meaning that gives you satisfaction, gives you a good feeling about what you did and often on human nature, which can be very good and also very bad. But often it's the things that help others that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction., you taught someone to read, you cared for someone who was terminally ill. You brought up a, a nice family, you, you brought up your kids. Um, you did a good job. You, you put your heart and soul into it, read a lot of books. If that's what you wanted to do, had a lot of perspectives on life. You, you traveled the world, if that's what you wanted to do. Um But if some of these things are not within reach, you're in a socio-economic position where you can't travel the world or whatever, you find other forms of, of meaning. It doesn't,, it doesn't have to be some profound. I'm gonna change the world. I'm gonna be the one who everyone remembers type thing, right?"
