  "Text": "brain works. How did life arise?, that's big, big questions but they to me don't indicate uh the existence of uh of, of, of an alien or something. I mean, unless we are the aliens, you know, we, we could have been contamination from some rocket ship that, that hit here a long, long time ago and all evidence of it has been destroyed. But again, that alien would have started out somewhere. They're not, they're not here watching us right now. Right. They're not among us. And so there are exp potential explanations for the fermi paradox and one of them that I kind of like is that the truly intelligent creatures are those that decided not to colonize the whole galaxy because they'd quickly run out of room there because it's exponential, right? You send a probe to a planet, it makes two copies, they go out, they make two copies each and it's an exponential, right? They, they quickly colonize the whole galaxy, but then distance to the next galaxy, the next big one like Andromeda, that's 2.5 million light years. That's a much grander scale now, right? so it, it also could be that the reason they survived this long is that they got over this tendency that may well exist among sufficiently intelligent creatures, this tendency for aggression and self destruction, right? If they bypass that, and that may be one of the great filters. If there are more than one, right, then they may not be type of creature that feels the need to go and say, oh there's a nice looking planet. Um and there's a bunch of, you know, ants on it, let's go squish them and colonize it. No, it could even be the kind of star trek like prime directive where you go and explore worlds, but you don't interfere in any way."
