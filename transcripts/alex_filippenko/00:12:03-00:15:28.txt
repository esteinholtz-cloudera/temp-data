  "Text": "stuff like that, you know, generically quintessence like the Aristotelian fifth essence. But there are many, many versions of quintessence, there's K essence, there's even ideas that, you know, this isn't something from within this dark energy, but rather there are a bunch of say bubble universes our universe. And this whole idea of the multiverse is not some crazy mad men type idea anymore. It's, you know, real card carrying physicists are seriously considering this possibility of a multiverse and some types of multiverses could have, you know, a bunch of bubbles on the outside which gravitationally act outward on our bubble. Because gravity or gravitons, the the quantum particle that is thought to carry gravity is is thought to the bulk the space between these different little bubble membranes and stuff. And so it's conceivable that these other universes are pulling outward on us. That's not a favored explanation right now. But, but really nothing has been ruled out. No class of models has been ruled out completely. Certain examples within classes of models have been ruled out. in general, I think we still have really a lot to learn about what's causing this observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe. Be it dark energy or some forces from the outside or, or perhaps, you know, I guess it's conceivable that sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night screening the dark energy that which causes the acceleration and dark matter that which causes Galaxies and clusters of Galaxies to be bound gravitationally even though there's not enough visible matter to do so, these are our 20th and 21st century Ptolemaic epic cycles. So Ptolemy had a Geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world, everything goes around earth. But in order to explain the backward motion planets among the stars that happens every year or two or sometimes several times a year for mercury and Venus, you needed the planets to go around in little circles called epic cycles which themselves then went around earth. And in this, in this part of the epic cycle where the planet is going in the direction, opposite to the direction of the overall epic cycle. It can appear in projection to be going backward among the stars so called retrograde motion. it was a brilliant mathematical scheme. In fact, he could have added epic cycles on top of epic cycles and reproduce the observed positions of planets to arbitrary accuracy. And this is really the beginning of what we now call for a analysis, right? Any periodic function can be represented by a sum of signs and cosigns of different periods, amplitudes and phases. So it could have worked arbitrarily well. other data, you know, show that in fact, earth is going around the sun. Uh so our dark energy and dark matter just these bandaids that we now have to try to explain the data, they're just completely wrong that that's a possibility as well. And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility. As an open minded scientist,"
