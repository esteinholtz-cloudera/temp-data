  "Text": "? Right. So a supernova is an exploding star. Most stars die a relatively quiet death. Our our own sun will, despite the fact that it'll become a red giant and incinerate earth, it'll do that reasonably slowly. But there's a small minority of stars that end their lives in a titanic explosion. that's not only exciting to watch from afar, but it's critical to our existence because it is in these explosions that the heavy elements synthesize through nuclear reactions during the normal course of the stars evolution. during the explosion itself, get ejected into the cosmos, making them available as raw material for new stars, planets and ultimately life, you know, and that's just a great story, um the best in, in some ways. So, you know, we like to study these things and, and our origins, but it turns out these are incredibly useful beacons as well because if you know how powerful an exploding star really is by measuring the apparent brightness at its peak in Galaxies, whose distances we already know through having made other measurements. And you can thus calibrate how powerful the thing really is. And then you find ones that are much more distant then you can use their observed brightness compared with their true intrinsic power or luminosity judge their distance and hence the distance of the galaxy in which they're located. So it's like looking at, if you'll uh let me just give this one analogy, uh you know, you judge the distance of an oncoming car at night by looking at how bright its headlights appear to be and you've calibrated how bright the headlights are of a car that's two or 3 m away of known distance and you go whoa, that's faint headlight. And so that's pretty far away. You also use the parent angular separation between the two headlights as a consistency check in your brain, but that's what your brain is doing. So we can do that for cars, we can do that for stars."
