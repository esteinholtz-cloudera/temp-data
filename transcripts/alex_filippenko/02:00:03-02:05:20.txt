  "Text": "could have and should have perhaps he should have perhaps gotten it with Hawking before Hawking's death. Right. The problem was Hawking radiation had not been detected. But you could argue that Hawking made enough other fundamental contributions to the theoretical study of black holes and the observed data were already good enough at the time of before Hawking's death. OK. I mean, the latest results by Reinhard Genzel group is that they see time dilation effect of a star that's passing very close to the black hole in the middle of our galaxy, that's cool. But, and it adds additional evidence, but hardly anyone doubted the existence of the supermassive black hole. And Andrea Guez's group, I believe, hadn't yet shown that relativistic effect and yet she got part of the prize as well. So clearly it was given for the, the original evidence that was really good and that evidence is at least a decade old, you know, so one could make the case for, for Hawking. One could make the case that in 2016, when Mayor and Klos won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the first exoplanet. Um uh 51 B, Pegasi. Well, there was a fellow at Penn State Alex Wha who in 1992 3 years preceding 1995 found a, a pul a planet orbiting a pulsar, a very weird kind of neutron star and that wouldn't have been a normal planet. Sure. And so the Nobel Committee, you know, they gave it for the discovery of planets around normal sunlike stars. But, but hell, you know, wha found a planet so they could have given it to him as the third person of to Jim Peebles for the development of what's called physical cosmology. He's at Princeton, he deserved it. But they could have given Nobel for the development of physical cosmology to Peebles and I would claim some other people were pretty important in that development as well, you know, and could have given it some other year. Um So there's, there's a lot of controversy. I try not to dwell on. It was I number three, probably not, you know, Adam Reese did the work. Um You know, I, I helped bounce ideas off of him but we wouldn't have had the result without him and I was on both teams for reasons. I mean, you know, I the, the style of the first team, the supernova cosmology project didn't match mine. came largely from experimental high energy particle physics physics where there's these hierarchical teams and stuff and it's hard for the little guy to, to have a say at least that's what I kind of thought. Whereas the team of astronomers led by Brian Schmidt was first of all, a bunch of my friends and they grew up as astronomers making contributions on little teams and we decided to band together, but all of us had our voices heard. So it was sort of a, a culture, a style that I preferred really. let me tell you a story at the Nobel banquet. Ok. sitting there between two physicists who are, who are members of the committee of the Swedish National Academy of Sciences. know, and I strategically kept, you know, offering them wine and stuff during this long drawn out nobel ceremony, right? And I got them to be pretty talkative. And then in a, in a polite diplomatic way, I started asking them pointed questions. And basically they admitted that if there are four or more people equally deserving, they wait for one of them to die or they just don't give the prize at all when it's unclear who the three are at least unclear to them, unclear to them. It's they, they're not even right part of the time. I mean, Jocelyn Bell discovered pulsars with a radio antennas, a set of radio antennas that her advisor Anthony Hugs and built. So he deserves some credit. But, but he didn't discover the pulsar. She did and his initial reaction to the data that she showed him was a condescending rubbish, my dear., I'm not kidding. Now, I know Jocelyn Bell and she did not let this destroy her life. She won every other prize under the sun. OK. Um Vera Rubin, one of the discoverers of dark matter. Although there, if you look at the history, there were a number of people that was the issue. I think there were a number of people, four or more who had similar data and similar ideas. At about the same time, Ruben won every prize under the sun. The new big large scale survey telescope being built in Chile is being renamed the Vera Ruben telescope because she passed away in December of 2015. I think um know, it, it'll conduct this survey, large scale survey with the Ruben telescope. So she's been recognized but never with the Nobel Prize. And I would say that to her credit, she did not let that consume her life either. And perhaps it was a bit easier because there had been no Nobel given for the discovery of dark matter. Whereas in the case of Pulsars and Jocelyn Bell, was a prize given for the Discovery of the Freaking pulsars and she didn't get it. I mean, what a travesty of"
