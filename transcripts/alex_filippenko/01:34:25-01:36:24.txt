  "Text": "traveling faster than the speed of light because locally at any point, if you were to measure the light, the photon zipping past, it would not be exceeding the speed of light. The speed of light is a locally measured quantity. After light has traversed some distance. If the rubber band keeps on stretching, yes, it looks like the light traveled a greater distance than it would have had the space not been expanding, but locally, it never was exceeding the speed of light. It's just that the distance through which it already traveled then went off and expanded on its own some more. if you give the light credit, so to speak, for having traversed that distance, well, then it looks like it's going faster than the speed of light, but that's not what's happening, right? That's not how speed works. Speed. And in relativity, also the other thing um that is interesting is that, you know, if you take two ping pong balls that are sufficiently far apart, especially in an accelerating universe, you can easily have them moving apart from one another faster than the speed of light. you know, take two ping pong balls that were originally 400,000 kilometers from each other and let every centimeter in your rubber band expand to two in one second. Then suddenly this 400,000 kilometer distance is 800,000 kilometers. went out by 400,000 kilometers in one second that exceeds the 300,000 kilometer per second speed of light. that light limit that that particle limit special relativity applies to objects moving through a pre-existing space. There's nothing in either special or general relativity that prevents space itself from expanding faster than the speed of light. That's no problem. Einstein wouldn't have had a problem with, with a, with a, with a universe as observed now by cosmologists."
