  "Text": "? So first of all, there are several different ways that stars can explode and it depends on their mass and whether they're in a binary system and things like that. the ones that we used for these cosmological purposes, studying the expansion of the history, history of the universe are the so-called type Roman numeral one lowercase A type one a supernovae. come from a weird type of a star called a white dwarf. Our own sun will turn into a white dwarf in about 7 billion years. It'll have about half its present mass compressed into a volume, just the size of earth. So that's an inordinate density. OK. It's incredibly dense the matter is what's called by quantum physicists degenerate matter. Not because it's morally reprehensible or anything like that. But this is just the name, yeah, quantum physicists give to electrons that are squeezed into a very tight space. The electrons take on emotion due to Heisenberg uncertain Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. And also due to the pow the exclusion principle that don't like to be in the same place, they like to avoid each other. So those two things mean that a lot of electrons are moving very rapidly, which gives the star an extra pressure far above the thermal pressure associated with just the random motions of particles inside the star. So it's a weird type of star, but normally it wouldn't explode and our sun won't explode. that if such a white dwarf is in a pair with another more or less normal star, it can steal material from that nor normal star until it gets to an unstable limit, rough, roughly 1.5 times the mass of our sun 1.4 or so. This is known as the Chandra Sekhar Chan Chandrasekhar limit after Subramanya Chandrasekar, an Indian astrophysicist who figured this out when he was about 20 years old a voyage from India to England where he was to be educated. And then he did this. And then 50 years later, he won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1984 largely for this work. OK. That he did as a youngster who was on his way to be educated, you know. Oh, and his advisor, the great Arthur Eddington in England who had done a lot of great things and was a great astrophysicist. Nevertheless, he too was human and had his faults. He Chandra's scientific work at a conference in England. And, you know, most of us, if we had been Chandra would have just given up astrophysics at that time, you know, when the Great Arthur Eddington, you know, ridicules our, our work. And that's another inspirational story for the youngster, you know, just, just keep going, you know. But anyway, your advisor, yeah, no matter what your advisor says, right? So, or don't always pay attention to your, right? Don't, don't be uh don't lose hope if you really think you're on to something that doesn't mean never listen to your advisor. They may have sage advice as well. But anyway, um you know, when a white dwarf grows to a certain mass, it becomes unstable. And one of the ways it can end its life is to go through a thermonuclear runaway. basically the carbon nuclei inside, the white dwarf starts start fusing together to form heavier nuclei. And the energy that those fusion reactions emit emits doesn't go into, um you know, being dissipated out of the star or, you know, whatever um or expanding it the way, you know, if you take a blowtorch through the middle of the sun, you heat up its gasses, the gasses would expand and cool, but this degenerate star can't expand and cool. And so the energy pumped in through these fusion reactions goes into making the nuclei move faster and that more of them sufficiently close together that they can undergo nuclear fusion, thereby releasing more energy that goes into speeding up more nuclei. And thus you have a, a runaway a bomb, a an uncontrolled nuclear fusion reactor, right? Instead of the controlled fusion, which is what our sun does. OK. Our sun is a marvelous controlled fusion reactor. This is what we need here on earth fusion energy to solve our energy crisis, right? But the sun holds the stuff in, you know, through gravity and you need a big mass to do that. So this un uncontrolled fusion reaction blows up a star that's pretty much the same in all cases. And you measure it to be almost the same in all cases, but the devils in the details. And in fact, we observe them to not be all the same theoretically they might not be all the same because the rate of the fusion reactions might depend on the amount of trace heavier elements in the white dwarf. And that could depend on how old it is when it was, you know, whether it was born billions of years ago when there weren't many heavier elements or whether it's a relatively young white dwarf and all kinds of other things. And part of my work was to show that indeed, not all the type one A s are the same. have to be careful when you use them, you have to calibrate them. They're not standard candles the way it just if all headlights or all candles were the same lumens or whatever you'd say they're standard and then it would be"
