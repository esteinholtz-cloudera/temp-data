  "Text": "an interesting thought. I'm certainly excited by the potential physics that suggest this kind of than light travel effectively or you know, cutting the distance to make it very, very short through a wormhole or something like that. Well, you know, call me not very imaginative but based on today's knowledge of physics, which I realize, you know, people have gone down that rabbit hole and you know, a century ago, Lord Kelvin, one of the greatest physicists of all time said that all of fundamental physics is done, the rest just engineering. And guess what then came special relativity, quantum physics, general relativity, how wrong he was. So let me not be another Lord Kelvin. On the other hand, I think we know a lot more now about what we know and what we don't know and what the physical limitations are. And to me, most of these schemes, if not all of them seem very far fetched, if not impossible. So travel through wormholes, for example, you know, it appears that a non rotating black hole, that's just a, a complete no go because the, the singularity is a point like singularity and you have to reach it to traverse the wormhole and you get squished by the singularity. OK., for a rotating black hole, it turns out there is a way to pass through the event horizon, the boundary of the black hole and avoid the singularity and go out the other side or even traverse the, the doughnut hole like singularity. In the case of a rotating black hole, it's a ring singularity. So there's actually theoretical ways you could get through a rotating black hole or a charged black hole. Not that we expect charged black holes to exist in nature because they would quickly bring in the opposite charge. So as to neutralize themselves. But rotating black holes definitely a reality, we, we now have good evidence for them. Do they have traversable wormholes? Probably not because it's still the case that when you go in, you go in with so much energy that it,, it either squeezes the wormhole shut or you encounter a whole bunch of incoming and outgoing energy that vaporizes you. It's called the mass inflation instability and it just sort of vaporizes you, you know, you could imagine, well, you're in some vapor form but if you make it through, maybe you could, you know, reform or something."
