  "Text": "a great question. So that I I meant to bring a little, a little prop I have with ping pong balls on a rubber hose, a rubber band. I I use it in many of the lectures that one can find of me online, but you have in an expanding universe, the space itself between Galaxies or more correctly, clusters of Galaxies expanding. imagine light going from one cluster to another, it traverses some distance and then while it's traversing the rest that part that it already traveled through continues to expand, billion years might have gone by the light that we are seeing from the early stages, the so-called cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the, the afterglow of the Big Bang or the echo of the Big Bang. Yeah, 13.7 billion years have gone by. That's how long it's taken that light to reach us. But while it's been traveling that distance, the parts that it already traveled continue to expand. it's like you're walking on at an airport, you know, on one of these walkways and you're walking along because you're trying to get to your terminal. But the walkway is continuing as well. You end up traveling a greater distance or the same distance faster is another way of putting it right. That's why you get on one of these traveling walkways. So you get a roughly roughly a factor of pie, it's more like 3.2 I think. But when you work it all out, you multiply the number of years, the universe has been in existence by, you know, three and a quarter or so. And that's how you get this 46 billion light-year radius."
