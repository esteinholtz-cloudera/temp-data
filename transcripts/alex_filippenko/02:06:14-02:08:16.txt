Well, humans like competition and they like heroes and unfortunately it gives the impression to youngsters today that science is still done, by white men with gray beards wearing white lab coats. And I'm very pleased to see that this year. You know, Andrea Guez, the fourth woman in the history of the physics Prize to have received it. And then, uh, two women, one at Berkeley, uh, one elsewhere won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry without any male code. And so that's sending a message, I think to girls that they can do science and they have, um, role models. I think, uh, the Breakthrough Prize and other such prizes show that teams get recognized as well. And, and if you pay attention to the newspapers, you know, most of the good authors like, you know, Dennis Overbuy of the New York Times and others said that these were teams of people and they, they emphasized that and, know, they all played a role. Um, and, you know, maybe if some grad student hadn't soldered some circuit, maybe the whole thing wouldn't have worked, you know. Um, but still, you know, Ray Weiss Kip Thorne was the theoretical uh know, impetus for the whole search for gravitational waves. Barry Barish brought the MIT and CALTECH teams together to get them to co-operate at a time when the project was nearly dead from what I understand and greatly to the experimental setup as well. He's a great experimental physicist, but he was really good at bringing these two teams together instead of having them duke it out in blows and leaving both of them bleeding and dying. You know, the National Science Foundation was gonna cut the funding from what I understand, you know. So, so there's human drama involved in this whole thing and the Olympics. Yeah, you know, a runner or a swimmer, a runner runner, you know, they, they slip at the moment that they were taking off from the first thing and that costs them some fraction of a second and that's it. They didn't win, you know, and"
