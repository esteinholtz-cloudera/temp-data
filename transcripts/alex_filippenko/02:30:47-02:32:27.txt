  "Text": ", it's, it's very, very rewarding when you have students who are really into it. And you know, going back to Feynman at Caltech, I was taking these graduate courses and there were two of us myself and Jeff Richman who's now a professor of Physics at University of California, Santa Barbara asked lots of questions. And a lot of the Caltech students are nervous about asking questions. They, they want to save face. They seem to think that if they ask a question, their peers might think it's a stupid question. Well, I didn't really care what people thought and Jeff Richman didn't either. And we ask all these questions and in, in fact, in many cases, they were quite good questions. And Feynman said, well, the rest of you should be having questions like this. And I remember one time in particular when said, you know, he said to the rest of the class, why is it always these two aren't, you aren't the rest of you curious about what I'm saying? Do you really understand it all that? Well, if so, why aren't you asking the next most logical question?, you guys are too scared to ask these questions that these two are asking. So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times where just the three of us sat and had lunch with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics. And so, yeah, he, he rubbed off on me and, you know, you encourage questions as well. Questions, you know, and uh, no, definitely. I mean, you know, I encourage questions. I, I like it when students ask questions, I tell them that they shouldn't feel shy about asking a question, probably half the students in the class would have that same question if they even understood the material enough to ask that question. Curiosity"
