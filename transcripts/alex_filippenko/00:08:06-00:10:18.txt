  "Text": "? Well, not really, but we're getting progressively better observational constraints. So, you know, different theories of what it might be predict different sorts of behavior for the evolution of the universe. And we've been measuring the evolution of the universe now the data appear to agree with the predictions of a constant density vacuum energy, a zero point energy. one can't prove that that's what it is because one would have to show that the numbers that the measured numbers agree with the predictions to an arbitrary number of decimal places. And of course, even if you've got 89, 1012 decimal places, what if in the 13th 1, the measurements significantly differ from the prediction, then the dark energy isn't this vacuum state ground state energy of the, of the vacuum? And so then it could be some sort of a a field, some sort of a new energy a little bit like like light like electromagnetism, but very different from light fills space. And that type of energy could in principle change in the distant future, it could become gravitationally attractive for all we know. There is a historical precedent to that and that is that the inflation with which the universe began when the universe was just a tiny blink of an, of an eye, old a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. You know, the universe went whoosh. It exponentially expanded dark energy like substance we call it the infla on that which inflated the universe later decayed into more or less normal gravitationally attractive matter. So the exponential early expansion of the universe did transition to a deceleration which then dominated the universe for about 9 billion years. And now this small amount of dark energy causing an acceleration about 5 billion years ago. And whether that will continue or not is something that we'd like to answer. But I don't know that we will anytime"
