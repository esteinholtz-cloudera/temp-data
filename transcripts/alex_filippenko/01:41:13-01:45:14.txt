  "Text": "that wrong of what happened before t equals zero. And whether there are other universes out there, I like to say that these are sort of on the boundaries of science. They're not just ideas that we wake up at three in the morning to go to the bathroom and say, oh, well, let's think about what happened before the Big Bang or let there be a multiplicity of universes. other words, we have real testable physics that we can use to draw certain conclusions that are plausibility arguments based on what we know. Now, admittedly there are not really direct tests of these. That's why I call them hypotheses. They're, they're not really elevated to a theory because a theory in science is really something that has a lot of experimental or observational support behind it. So they're, they're hypotheses, but they're, they're not unreasonable hypotheses based on what you know about general relativity and quantum physics. OK. they may have indirect tests and that if you adopt this hypothesis, then there might be a bunch of things you expect of the universe. And lo and behold, that's what we measure. But we're not actually measuring anything at t less than zero or we're not actually measuring the presence of another universe in this multiverse. And yet there are these indirect ideas that stem forth. it's hard to prove uniqueness and it's hard to completely convince oneself that a certain hypothesis must be true. you know, the more and more tests you have that it satisfies, let's say there are 50 predictions it makes and of them are in, are, are things that you can measure. And then the 50th 1 is the one where you, you want to measure the actual existence of that other universe or what happened before T equals zero and you can't do that., but you've satisfied 49 of the other testable predictions. And so that's science right now, uh a conventional condensed matter physicist or someone who deals with real data in the laboratory might say, oh, you cosmologist, you know, that's not really science because it's not directly testable, but I would say it's sort of testable but, but it's not completely testable. And so it's at the boundary, but it's not like we're coming up with these crazy ideas, them quantum fluctuations out of nothing and then inflating into a universe with, you might say, well, you created a giant amount of energy. But in fact, this quantum fluctuation out of nothing, you know, in a quantum way violates the conservation of energy. But you know who cares? That was a classical law anyway. And then an inflating universe maintains whatever energy it had be it zero or some infinite usable amount. In a sense, the stuff of the universe has a positive energy there's a negative gravitational energy associated with it. It's like I drop an apple. I got kinetic energy energy of motion out of that, but I did work on it to bring it to that height. So by going down and gaining energy of motion 12345 units of kinetic energy, it's also gaining or losing depending on when, how you want to think of it negative 12345 units of potential energy. So the total energy remains the same, an inflating universe can, can do that or other physicists say that energy isn't conserved in general relativity. another way out of CRE creating a universe out of nothing, you know. But the point is that this is all based on reasonably well tested physics. And although these extrapolations seem kind of outrageous at first, they're not completely outrageous, they're, they're within the realm of what we call science already. maybe some young young whippersnapper will be able to figure out a way to directly test what happened before to equal zero or to test for the presence of these other universes. But right now, we don't have a way of doing that."
