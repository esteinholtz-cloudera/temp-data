  "Text": "a new discovery, I mean that the Kepler satellite which was flying around above earth's atmosphere was able to monitor the brightness of stars with exquisite detail. And they could detect planets crossing the line of sight between us and the star thereby dimming its light for a short time ever so slightly. it's, it's amazing. So there are now thousands and thousands of these exoplanet candidates of which something like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets. And you have to remember that only about 1% of stars have their planetary system oriented edge on to your line of sight, which is what you need for this transit method to work, right, some arbitrary angle won't work and certainly perpendicular to your line of sight that is in the plane of the sky won't work because the the the planet is orbiting the star and never crossing your line of sight. So the fact that um you know, they found planets orbiting about 1% of the stars that they looked at in this field of 100 and 50 plus 1000 stars, found planets around 1%. You then multiply by the inverse of 1% which is, you know, right 1% is about how many, what the fraction of the, of the stars that have their planetary system oriented the right way. that already back of the envelope calculation tells you that uh of order 50 to 100% of all stars have planets. OK. And then they've been finding these earthlike planets, et cetera, et cetera. So there are many potential homes. The problem is getting there. Ok. So then a typical bright star, sir, uh the brightest star in the sky, maybe not a typical bright star, but it's 8.7 light years away. Ok. So that's, that means the light took 8.7 years to reach us. We're seeing it as it was about nine years ago. Ok. So then you know, you ask, how long would a rocket take to get there at earth's escape speed, which is 11 kilometers per second? Ok. And it turns out it's about a quarter of a million years. Ok. Now that's 10,000 generations. Ok. Let's say a generation of humans is 25 years, right? you'd need this colony of people is able to sustain itself all their food, all their waste disposal, all their water, all the recycling of everything for 10,000 generations, they have to commit themselves to living on this vehicle. Right? just don't see it happening. What I see potentially happening if we avoid self destruction, intentional or unintentional here on earth is that machines will do it, robots that can essentially hibernate. They don't need to do much of anything for a long, long time as they're traveling. And moreover, if some energetic charged particles, some cosmic ray hits the circuitry, it fixes itself, right? Machines can do this. Uh mean, it, it, it's a form of artificial intelligence, you just tell the thing, fix yourself basically. And then when you land on the, on the planet, start producing copies of yourself initially from materials that were perhaps sent or you just have a bunch of copies there and then they set up, you know, factories with which to do this. I mean, this is very, very futuristic, but much more feasible I think than sending flesh and blood over interstellar distances a quarter of a million years to even the nearest stars. You're subject to all kinds of charged particles and radio. have to, you know, shield yourself really well. That's by the way, one of the problems of going to Mars is that it's not a three day journey like going to the moon, you're out there for the better part of a year or two and you're exposed to lots of radiation, you know, which typically doesn't do well with living tissue, right? Or living tissue doesn't do well with the radiation."
