  "Text": ", gives birth to expanding gasses that are chemically enriched and those expanding gasses mixed with other chemically enriched, expanding gasses or primordial clouds of hydrogen and helium. I mean, th this is, um, in a sense that the greatest story ever told. Right. I try to, I teach this introductory astronomy course at, at Berkeley and tell them there's only five or six things that I, I want them to really understand and remember and I'm gonna come to their death bed and I'm gonna ask them about this and if they get it wrong, I will retroactively fail. Their whole career will have been shot that and they don't know and observe a total and yet they had the opportunity to do so. I will retroactively fail them. But one of them is, you know, where did we come from? Where did the elements in our DNA come from the carbon in our cells? The oxygen that we breathe, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our red blood cells, those elements, the phosphorus in our DNA, they, they all came from stars from nuclear reactions in stars and they were ejected into the cosmos. in some cases like iron made during the explosions and those gasses drifted out, mixed with other clouds, made a new star or a star cluster, of whose members then evolved and exploded. Thus enriching the gasses in the galaxy progressively more with time until finally, 4.5 billion years ago. From one of these chemically enriched clouds, our solar system formed with a rocky earth like planet. And somewhere somehow these self replicating, evolving molecules, bacteria formed and evolved through and amoebas and slugs and, and apes and, and us and here we are sentient beings that can ask these questions about our very origins and with our intellect and with the machines, we make to a reasonable understanding of our origins. a beautiful story. I mean, if that does not put you at least in awe, if not in love with science and its power of deduction. I don't know what? Well, right. It, it's, it's one of the greatest stories, if not the greatest story o obviously that's, you know, personality dependent and all that. It's a, it's a subjective opinion, but it's perhaps the greatest story ever ever told. mean, you could link it to the Big Bang and go even farther, right, to make an even more complete story. But as, as a subset, that's even in some ways, a greater story than, than even the existence of the universe in some ways because you could end up, you could just imagine some really boring universe that never leads to sentient creatures such as ourselves."
