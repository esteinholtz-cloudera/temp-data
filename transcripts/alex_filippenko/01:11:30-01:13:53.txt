  "Text": "those are possible yet. I, I think that to me, the most likely explanation for the Perry me paradox is that they really are very, very rare and, you know, Carl Sagan estimated 100,000 of them, there's that many, some of them would have been way ahead of us. And, and I think we would have seen them by now. If there were a handful, maybe they're there. But at that point, you're right on this dividing line between being a pessimist and an optimist and, and what are the odds for that? Right. If you look at all the things that had to go right for us and then, you know, getting back to something you said earlier, let's discuss, you know, primitive life. That could be thing that's difficult to achieve. Just getting the random molecules together to a point where they start self replicating and evolving and becoming better and all that., that's an inordinately difficult thing I think though I'm not, you know, some molecular cell biologist, but just it's, it's, it's the usual argument. You know, you're wandering around in the Sahara desert and you stumble across a watch is your, is your initial response? Oh You know, bunch of sand grains just came together randomly and formed this watch. No, you, you think that something formed it or it came from some simpler structure that then became, you know, more complex. All right, it didn't just uh form. Well, even the simplest life is is a very, very complex structure. Even the even the simplest prokaryotic cells, not to mention eukaryotic cells. Although that transition may have been the so-called great filter as well. Maybe cells without a nucleus are relatively easy to form. And then the big next step is where you have a nucleus which then provides a lot of energy which allows the cell to become much, much more complex and so on. Interestingly, going from cells, single cells to multicellular organisms does not appear to be at least on earth. One of these great filters because there's evidence that it happened dozens of times independently on earth. So by, by a really great filter, something that happens very, very rarely. I mean that we had to get through obstacle that is just incredibly rare to get through."
