  "Text": ", I don't know whether it's more because as I said, I actually think uh human induced threats or things that occur naturally on earth, either a natural pandemic or perhaps, you know, a bioengineering type pandemic or, you know, something like a super volcano, right? Um was one event TOBA, I think it was 70 plus 1000 years ago that that caused a, a gigantic decrease in temperatures on earth because it sends up, it sent up so much soot that it blocked the sun, right? It's the nuclear winter type disaster scenario that some people including Carl Sagan talked about decades ago. But we can see in the history of volcanic eruptions even more recently in the 19th century Tambora and other ones you look at the record you see uh rather large dips in temperature associated with massive volcanic eruptions. Well, these super volcanoes, one of which by the way exists under Yellowstone, you know, in the central U si mean, it's not just, it's not just one or two states, it's a, it's a gigantic region. Uh And there's controversy as to whether it's likely to blow anytime in the next 100,000 years or so, that would be perhaps not a mass extinction because you really need to, or, or perhaps not a complete existential threat because you have to get rid of sort of the very last humans for that., but at least getting rid of, um, you know, killing off so many humans, truly billions and billions of humans, the one that there have been ones of thousands of years ago, including this one, TOBA, I think it's called where it's estimated that the human population was down to 10,000 or 5000 individuals, something like that. Right. If you have a 15 degree drop in temperature over quite a time, it's not clear that even with today's advanced technology, we would be able to adequately respond, at least for the vast majority of people. Maybe some would be in these underground caves where you'd keep the president and a bunch of other important people, you know, but, but the typical person is not going to be protected when, when all of agriculture, is cut off. Right. And"
