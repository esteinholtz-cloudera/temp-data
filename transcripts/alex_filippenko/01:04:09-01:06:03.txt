  "Text": "brings me to the fourth, the fourth issue and that is the, you know, the fermi paradox, if they're common, where the hell are they? You know, notwithstanding the various UFO reports in Roswell and all that, they just don't meet the bar, they don't clear the bar of scientific, scientific evidence in my opinion. Ok. So, you know, there's, there's no clear evidence that they've ever visited us on earth here., a and you know, Seti has been now, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been scanning the skies and true. We've only looked a couple of 100 light years out and that's a tiny fraction of the whole galaxy, a tiny fraction of these 100 billion plus stars. Nevertheless, you know, if, if, if the, if the galaxy were teeming with life, intelligent life, you'd expect some of it to have been far more advanced than ours. OK. There's no special, nothing special about when the industrial revolution started on earth, right? The chemical evolution of our galaxy was such that billions of years ago, processing and stars had built up clouds of gas after their explosion that were rich enough in heavy elements to have formed earthlike planets even billions of years ago. So there could be civilizations that are billions of years ahead of hours. And if you look at the exponential growth of technology among Homo Sapiens in the last couple of 100 years and you just project that forward. I mean, there's no telling what they could have achieved even in 1000 or 10,000 years, let alone a million or 10 million or a billion years. And if they reach this capability of interstellar travel and colonization, then you can show that within 10 million years or certainly 100 million years, you can populate the whole galaxy. All right. And they, you know, so then you don't have to have, to detect them beyond 100 or 1000 light years, they would already be here."
