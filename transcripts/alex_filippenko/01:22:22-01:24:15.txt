  "Text": "don't know what to think about. So, David Fra is the first person. He's a navy pilot commander and there's a bunch of them, but he's sort of one of the most legit pilots and people I've ever met the fact that he saw something weird. He doesn't know what the heck it is. saw something weird. I mean, I don't know what to do with that. And on the psychological side, so I'm pretty confident he what he says, he saw which he's not, he's saying it's something weird. of the interesting psychological things that worries me is that everybody in the Navy, everybody in the US government, everybody in the scientific community just kind of like pretended that nothing happened. That kind of instinct. That's what makes me believe if aliens show up, we would all just ignore their presence. That's what bothered me that you don't, don't investigate it more carefully and use this opportunity to inspire the world. So in terms of kryptonite, think the conspiracy theory, folks that whenever there is some good hard evidence that scientists will be excited about, there's this kind of conspiracy that I don't like because it's ultimately negative that the US government will somehow hide the good evidence to protect it. Of course, there's some legitimacy to it because you want to protect military secrets, all that kind of stuff. But yeah, I don't know, I don't know what to do with this beautiful mess because think millions of people are inspired by UFO S and it feels like an opportunity to inspire people about science."
