  "Text": "you've built, right? This is why I'm saying that, you know, as an objective scientist, one needs to have an open mind to crazy sounding new ideas. And you know, even Copernicus was very much a man of and dedicated his work to the Pope. He still used circular orbits. The sun was a little bit off center, it turns out and a slightly off center circle looks like a slightly eccentric elliptical orbit. So then when Kepler in fact showed that the orbits are actually in general ellipses, not circles, the reason that, you know, he needed to cobra has really great data to show that distinction that a slightly off center circle is not much different from a slightly eccentric ellipse. And so there wasn't much difference between Kepler's view and uh Copernicus's view and, and Kepler needed the better data. Uh Tuco's Tuco Bra's data. And so that's again a great example of, of, of science obser observations and experiments working together with hypotheses and they, they kind of bounce off each other, they play off of each other and you continually need more observations. And it wasn't until Galileo's work around 1610, that actual evidence for the Heliocentric hypothesis emerged. It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus going through all of the possible phases from New to Crescent to quarter to Gius to full to waning Gius, third quarter, waning crescent and then new again, it turns out Ptolemaic system with Venus between earth and the sun, but always roughly in the direction of the sun, you could only get the new and crescent phases of Venus. But the observation showed a full set of phases. And moreover, when Venus was Gbu or full, that meant it was on the far side of the sun, that meant it was from earth than when it's crescent. So it should appear smaller and indeed it did. So that was a, that was, you know, the nail in the coffin in a sense. And then, you know, Galileo's other great observation was that Jupiter has moons going around it, the four Galilean satellites. And even though Jupiter moves through space, so too, do the moons go with it? So first of all, Earth is not the only thing that has other things going around it. And secondly, could be moving as Jupiter does and you know, things would move with it. We we wouldn't fly off the surface and our moon wouldn't be left behind and all this kind of stuff. So that was a a big breakthrough as well, but it wasn't as definitive in my opinion as the phases of Venus,"
