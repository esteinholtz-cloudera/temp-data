  "Text": ", that's right. Yeah. Monitoring the asteroid belt is very important and 99% of the so called near earth objects ultimately from the asteroid belt. And so there we can track the trajectories and even if there's, you know, a close encounter between two asteroids which deflects one of them toward earth, it's unlikely to be on a collision course with earth in the immediate future, it's more like, you know, tens of years. So that gives us time, but we would need to improve our ability to detect the objects that come in from a great distance. Unfortunately, those are, are much rarer the the comets come in, know, 1% of the collisions perhaps are comets that come in without any warning hardly. so, that that might be more like, you know, a billion or 2 billion years before one of those hits us. Um So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter on that time scale. I mean, there's the possibility that a star will explode near us in the next couple of billion years. But over the course of the history of life on earth, the estimates are that one of the mass extinctions, you know, was caused by a star blowing up in particular, a special kind called a gamma ray burst. And the, I think it's the or division solar uh silurian or division silurian extinction 420 or so 440 million years ago, that is speculated to have come from one of these particular types of exploding stars called gamma ray bursts. But even there, the the evidence is circumstantial. those kinds of existential threats are, are reasonably rare. The greater danger I think is civilization changing events where it's a much smaller asteroid, uh which those are harder, harder to detect or, or a giant solar flare that shorts out the grid all of North America, let's say now, you know, astronomers are monitoring the sun 24 7 with various satellites. And we can tell when there's a, a flare or a coronal mass ejection. And we can tell that in a day or two, a giant bundle of energetic particles will arrive and twang the magnetic field of earth and send all kinds of currents through long distance power lines. And that's what shorts out. transformers and transformers are, you know, expensive and, and hard to replace and hard to transport and all that kind of stuff. So we can warn the power companies and they can shut down the grid before the big bundle of particle hits, then we will have mitigated much of this. Now for a big enough bundle of particles, you can get short circuits even over small distance scales. So not everything will be saved. But at least the whole grid might not go out. So again, you know, astronomers, I'd like to say, your local astronomer. They may help someday save humanity by telling the power companies to shut down the grid finding the asteroid 50 or 100 years before it hits. Then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it. So many of these cosmic threats, cosmic existential threats we can actually and do something about or observe before they hit and do something about. So it's,"
