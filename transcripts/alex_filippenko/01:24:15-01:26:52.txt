  "Text": "I would say, you know, a as Carl Sagan used to say extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, right? I've quoted him a number of times. Uh would, we would welcome such evidence. Uh On the other hand, know, a lot of the things that are seen or perhaps even hidden from us, you could imagine for military purposes, surveillance purposes, the US government doesn't want us to know. Or maybe some of these pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or whatever uh satellites, right? A lot of the or some of the crashes that have occurred were later found to be, you know, weather balloons or whatever, know, when there are more conventional explanations. Science tends to stay away from the um from the sensational ones, right? And so it may be that someone else is calling in life is to investigate these phenomena. And I welcome that as a scientist, I, I don't categorically actually deny the possibility ships of some sort could have visited us because as I said earlier at slow speeds, there's no problem in reaching other stars. In fact, our Voyager and pioneer spacecraft in a few million years are gonna be in the vicinity of different stars, we can even calculate which ones they're going to be in the vicinity of. Right. Uh So there's nothing that breaks any laws of physics if you do it slowly. But that's different, you know, just having Voyager or pioneer by some star that's different from having active aliens altering the trajectory of their vehicle in real time spying on us. And then either zipping back to their home planet or sending signals that tell them about us because they are likely many years, many light years away and they're not gonna have broken that barrier as well. Ok. Right. So, so, I just, you know, ahead, study them. Great. I, you know, for some young kid who wants to do it, it might be their calling and that's how they might find meaning in their lives is to be the scientist who really explores these things. I chose not to because at a very young age, I found the evidence to the degree that I investigated it to be really quite unconvincing I had other things that I wanted to do, but I don't categorically deny the possibility and I think it should be investigated."
