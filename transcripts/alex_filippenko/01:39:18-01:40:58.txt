  "Text": ". Yeah, because you have to ask, how would you actually measure it? Now, I sometimes say to my cosmology, theoretical friends, well, if I took, if I were God and I were outside this whole thing and I took a Godlike,, in time, wouldn't it be finite no matter how big it is? And they object and they say Alex, you, you can't be outside and take a Godlike slice of time. You know, because there's nothing outside. Well, I'm not, you know, also, you know what slice of time you're taking depends on your emotion. And that's true. Even in special relativity, that of time get tilted in a sense if you're moving quickly, the axes X and T actually become tilted, not, not perpendicular to one another. Um And, you know, you can look at Ryan Green's books and lectures and other things where he, he imagines taking a loaf, loaf of bread and slicing it in units of time as you progress forward. But then if you're zipping along relative to that of bread, the slices of time actually become tilted. And so it's not even clear what slices of time mean. But I, I'm an observational astronomer, I know which end of the telescope to look through. And the way I understand the infinity is as I just told you that operationally or observationally there, no there'd be no way of seeing that it's a finite universe of measuring a finite universe. And so in that sense, it's, it's infinite, if it started out as a finite little dot Not a dot I'm sorry, a finite little hyper sphere,"
