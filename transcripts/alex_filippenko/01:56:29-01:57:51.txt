  "Text": "know, there were the two team leaders, Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt and usually it's the team leaders that are recognized. And then Adam Reese was my postdoc. Um He was, I guess first, I was second author of that paper. Yeah, so I was his direct mentor at the time, although he was, you know, one of these people who just, know, runs with things, he was an MIT undergraduate, by the way, um Harvard graduate student and then a postdoc as a so called Miller fellow for Basic Research and Science at Berkeley, something that I was back in 84 to 86. But you're, you're, you know, you're largely a free agent, but he worked quite closely with me and he came to Berkeley to work with me. And on Schmidt's team, was charged with analyzing the data and he measured the brightnesses of these distant supernovae showing that they're fainter and thus more distant than anticipated. And that led to this conclusion that the universe had to have accelerated in order to push them out to such great distances. I was shocked when he showed me the data, the results of his calculations and measurements. Um but it's very, you know, so he deserved it. And on Saul's Gerson Gerson Goldhaber deserved it. But he died, I think a year earlier in 2010. But that would have been four and so me while I was on both teams, but, you know, was I number 4567, I don't know,"
