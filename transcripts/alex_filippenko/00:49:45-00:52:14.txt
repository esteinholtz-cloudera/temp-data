  "Text": "it'll, but it'll also be much more able to survive the onslaught of existential threats that either we bring upon ourselves or don't anticipate here on earth or that occasionally come from beyond. And there's nothing much we can do about a supernova explosion that just suddenly, you know, goes off and, and, and really, if we want to move to other planets outside our solar system, I think realistically, a much better option than thinking that humans will actually make these gigantic journeys. And you know, then I do this calculation for my class, you know, Einstein's special theory of relativity says that you can do it in a short amount of time in your own frame of reference if you go close to the speed of light, then you bring in E equals MC squared and you figure out how much energy it takes to get you accelerated to close enough to the speed of light to make the time scale short in your own frame of reference. And the amount of energy is just unfathomable, right? We can do it at the large Hadron Collider with, with protons, you know, we can accelerate them to 99.9999% of the speed of light that's just a proton, we're gazillions of protons, ok. And that doesn't even count the rocket that would carry us the payload. And you would need to either store the fuel in the rocket, which then requires even more mass for the rocket or collect fuel along the way, which, you know, is difficult. And getting close to the speed of light, I think is not an option either other than for a little tiny thing like, you know, Yuri Milner and others are thinking about this, this star shot project where they'll send a little tiny camera to Alpha Centauri 4.2 light years away. They'll zip past it, a picture of the exoplanets that we know orbit that three or more star system and uh say hello, say hello real quickly and then send the images back to us. OK. So that, that's a tiny little thing, right? Maybe you can accelerate that to, they're hoping 20% of the speed of light with a whole bunch of high powered lasers aimed at it. It's not clear that other countries will allow us to do that by the way. But that's a very forward looking thought. I mean, I very much support the idea, there's a big difference between sending a little tiny camera and sending a payload of people with equipment that could then mine the um the the, the resources on the exoplanet that they reach and, and then go forth and multiply."
