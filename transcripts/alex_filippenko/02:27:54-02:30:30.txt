  "Text": "sort of physical, how do you draw a mental picture or a picture on paper of what's going on? And he's perhaps most famous in this regard for his Feynman diagrams, which in what's called quantum electrodynamics, a quantum field theory of electricity and magnetism, you have are actually, you know, an exchange of photons between charged particles and they might even be virtual photons if the particles are at rest relative to one another. there are ways of doing calculations that are brute force that take pages on pages and pages of calculations. And Julian Schwinger uh developed some of the mathematics for that and won the Nobel Prize for it. But Feynman had these diagrams that he made and he had a set of rules of what to do at the vertex, you know, you'd have two particles coming together and then a particle going out and then two particles coming out again. And he'd have these rules associated when there were vertices and when there were particles splitting off from one another and all that, it looked a little bit like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first. But to those who learned the rules and understood them, he, you know, they, they saw that you could do these complex calculations in a much simpler way. And indeed, in, in some ways, Freeman Dyson had an even better knack for explaining quantum electrodynamics actually was. But I didn't know Freeman Dyson, I, I knew Feynman, maybe he did have a more intuitive view of the world than Feynman did. But of the people I knew Feynman was the most intuitive most sort of, is there a picture, is there a simple way you can understand this? And in, in um the path that a particle follows even, you know, you can figure out the, you can get the classical path, at least, you know, for a baseball or something like that by using quantum physics if you want. But know, in a sense, the baseball sniffs out all possible paths. It goes out to the Andromeda galaxy and then goes to the, to the batter. But the probability of doing that is very, very small because tiny little paths next door to any given path cancel out that path. And the ones that all add together, they, are the ones that are more likely to be followed. And this actually ties in with Fairmont's principle of least action and their ideas and optics that go into this as well. And, and it just sort of beautifully brings everything together, but the particle sniffs out all possible paths, what a crazy idea. But if you do the mathematics associated with that, it ends up being actually useful, a useful way of looking at the"
