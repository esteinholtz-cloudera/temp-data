  "Text": "information. It's scrambled information. But there's a way maybe of bringing it back. Right. But then the thing that really bothers me is that as soon as you have this possibility of traversal of a wormhole, have to come to grips with a fundamental problem. And that is that you could come back to your universe at a time prior to your leaving and you could essentially prevent your grandparents from ever meeting. This is called the grandfather paradox, right? And if they never met and if your parents were never born and if you were never born, how would you have made the journey to prevent history from allowing you to exist? Right? It's, it's a, it's a causal, it's a violation of causality of cause and effect. Now, physicists such as myself take causality violation very, very seriously. never seen it. Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, it's one of these right back to the future type movies, right? And you have to work things out in such a way that you don't mess things up, right? Some people say that, well, you come back to the universe, but you come back in such a way that you cannot affect your journey. But then, I mean, that, that seems kind of uh contrived to me or some say that you end up in a different universe. And this also goes into the, the many different types of the multiverse hypothesis and the many worlds interpretation and all that. But again, then it's not the universe from which you left, right? And you don't come back to the universe from which you left. And so not really going back in time to the same universe and you're not even going forward in time necessarily then to the same universe, right? You're ending up in some other universe. So, you've, you've, what have you achieved, right? You, you've"
