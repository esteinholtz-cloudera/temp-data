  "Text": ". astronomers like to say, I don't like that term because there aren't any standard candles, but there are standardized candles. And by looking at these, yeah, you calibrate, standardized calibrate, you look at enough of them in nearby Galaxies whose distances, you know, independently. And what you can tell is that, know, uh and this is something that a colleague of mine, Mark Phillips did, who was on Schmidt's team. And arguably one of the was one of the people who deserved the Nobel Prize. But he showed that the intrinsically more powerful type one A s um uh decline in brightness and it turns out rise in brightness as well more slowly than the less luminous one A's. And so if you calibrate this by measuring a whole bunch of nearby ones and then you look at a distant one of saying, well, it's a 100 watt type one, a supernova. They're much more powerful than that, by the way, plus or minus 50 you can say no, it's, it's 100 and 12 plus or minus 15 or it's, or it's 84 plus or minus 17, you, it tells you where it is in the power scale and it greatly decreases the uncertainties. And that's what makes these things cosmological useful. showed that if you spread the light out into a spectrum, you can tell spectroscopic that these things are different as well. And in 1991 I happened to study two of the extreme peculiar ones, the low luminosity ones and the high luminosity ones, BG and 1991 T this showed that not all the one A's are the same. And indeed, at the time of 1991 I was a little bit skeptical that we could use type one A s because of this diversity that I was observing. in 1993 Mark Phillips wrote a paper that showed this correlation between the light curve, the brightness versus time and the peak luminosity and once"
