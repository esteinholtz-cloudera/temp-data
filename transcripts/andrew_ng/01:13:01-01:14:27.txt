  "Text": "Frankly, I think it's all of them. some of the ones I'm spending a lot of time on are manufacturing, agriculture, looking to health care. Um For example, in manufacturing, uh we do a lot of work in visual inspection where today there are people standing around using the eye, human eye to check if you know this plastic pot or the smartphone or this thing a scratch or a dent or something in it. Um We can use a camera to take a picture, use a algorithm, deep learning and other things to check if it's defective or not. Uh and thus help factories improve yield and improve quality and improve throughput. turns out the practical problems we run into are very different than the ones you might read about. In, in most research papers, the data sets are really small. So we face small data problems. Um you know, the factories keep on changing the environment so it works well. On your test set. But guess what, you know, the, the something changes in the factory, the lights go on or off. Recently, we there was a factory in which um a bird flew through the factory and pooped on something. And so that, you know, so that changed stuff and so our algorithm make robustness. So all the changes happen in the factory. Uh I find that we run a lot of practical problems that that are not as widely discussed in, in academia. And it's really fun kind of being on the cutting edge solving these problems before, know, maybe before many people are even aware that there is a problem"
