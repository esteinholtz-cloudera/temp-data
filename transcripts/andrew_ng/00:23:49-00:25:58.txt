  "Text": "arts., I can tell you the thing we got wrong. The thing we got right. The thing we really got wrong was the importance of uh the early importance of unsupervised learning. So uh early days of Google Brain, we put a lot of effort into unsupervised learning rather than supervised learning. And there was this argument, I think it was around 2005 after, you know, Europe at that time called Nips. But now Europe had ended. uh Jeff Finton and I were sitting in the cafeteria outside, you know, the conference, we had lunch with us chatting and Jeff pulled up this napkin. He started sketching this argument on a on a napkin. It was very compelling. I repeat it. Um Human brain has about 100 trillion. So that's 10 to the 14 synaptic connections. Uh You will live for about 10 to the nine seconds. That's 30 years. You actually live for 222 by 10 to 9, maybe three by 10 to 9 seconds. So just let's say 10 to 9. if each synaptic connection, each weight in your brains, your network has just a one bit parameter. That's 10 to the 14 bits, you need to learn in up to 10 to 9 seconds of your life. So by the simple argument with a lot of problems is very simplified. That's 10 to the five bits per second, you need to learn in your life. And um I have a one year old daughter. Uh I am not pointing out to 5 bits per second of labels to her. So, and, and I think I'm, I'm very loving parent, but I'm just not going to do that. Um So from this, you know, very crude, definitely problematic argument, there's just no way that most of what we know is through supervised learning. The way you get so many bits of information is from sucking in images, audio, those experiences in the world. And so that argument and, and there are a lot of no forces argument you should go into really convinced me that there's a lot of power on civilized learning. Um So that was the part that we actually maybe, maybe got wrong. I still think Univ learning is really important. But we, uh but, but in the early days, you know, 1015 years ago, a lot of us thought that was the path forward."
