  "Text": ". And and and the software system needs to interface with people's workloads. So machine learning is automation on steroids if we take one task out of many tasks are done in the factory. So the factory does lots of things. One task is vision inspection. If we automate that one task, it can be really valuable. But you may need to redesign a lot of other tasks around that one task. For example, the machine learning algorithm says this is defective. What are you supposed to do? Do you throw it away? Do you get a human to double check? Do you want to rework it or fix it? Uh So you need to redesign a lot of tasks around that thing, you've now automated. So planning for the change management and making sure that the software you write is consistent with the new workflow and you take the time to explain to people what needs to happen. I think um what landing A I has become at uh And then I think we learned by making steps and you know, painful experiences. My what what would become good at is working with upon this to think through um all the things beyond just the machine learning model, you put the notebook but uh build the entire system man, the change process and figure out how to deploy this in a way that has an actual impact. processes that the large software tech companies use for deploying don't work for a lot of other scenarios. For example, when I was leading, you know, large speech teams, um if the speech recognition system goes down what happens? Well, alarm goes off and then someone like me will say, hey, you 20 engineers please fix this and it will get. But if you have a system go in the factory, there are not 20 machine learning engineers sitting around, you can page a duty and have them fix it. So how do you with the maintenance or the, or the DE S or the M OS or the other aspects of this? So these are um concepts, I think landing A I and a few other teams on the cutting Asia. But we don't even have systematic technology yet to describe some of the stuff we do because I think we're, we're inventing it on the fly."
