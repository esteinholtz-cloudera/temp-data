  "Text": "remember when I was leading the A I group at uh Baidu, um I had two jobs, two parts of my job. One was to build an A I engine to support the existing businesses and that, that, that was running, just ran, just performed by itself. The second part of my job at the time, which is to try to systematically initiate new lines of businesses using the company's A I capabilities. So, know, the self driving car team came out of my group, the smart speaker team uh similar to what is um Amazon echo Alexa in the US, but we actually announced it before Amazon did. So I do wasn't following, wasn't following Amazon that that came out of my group And I found that to be um actually the most fun part of my job. So what I want to do was to build A I fund as a start of studio systematically create new start up from scratch with all the things we can now do with A I, I think the ability to build new teams to go after this rich space of opportunities is a very important way to very important mechanism to get these projects done that I think will move the world forward. So I, I've been fortunate to build a few teams that had a meaningful, positive impact and I felt that um we might better do this in a more systematic repeatable way. a start up studio is a relatively new concept. There, there are maybe dozens of start up studios, you know, right now. Uh But uh I feel like all of us, many teams are still trying to figure out how do you systematically build companies with a high success rate? So I think um even a lot of my, you know, venture capital friends are seem to be more and more building companies rather than investing in companies. But I find it fascinating thing to do figure out the mechanisms by which we could systematically build successful teams, successful businesses um in, in areas that we find meaningful. So start up"
