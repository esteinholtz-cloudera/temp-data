  "Text": "up in Hong Kong and Singapore. I started learning to code when I was five or six years old. At that time, I was learning the basic programming language and I would take these books and, you know, they'll tell you type this program into your computer. So type that program on your computer. And as a result of all that typing, uh I would get to play these very simple, shoot them up games that, that, you know, I had implemented on my, on my little computer. I thought it was fascinating as a young kid that I could write this code that was really just copying code from a book into my computer to then play these cooler video games. Another moment for me was um when I was a teenager and my father because the doctor was reading about expert systems and about neural networks. So he got me to read some of these books. And um I thought it was really cool if you could provide the computer that started to exhibit intelligence, I remember doing an internship while I was in high school. Uh This is in Singapore where I remember doing a lot of photocopying and, and office assistant. Um And the highlight of my job was when I got to use the shredder. the teenager me thinking boy, this is a lot of photocopying. If only we could write software, build a robot, something to automate this, maybe I could do something else. So I think a lot of my work since then um has centered on the theme of automation. Even the way I think about machine learning today, we're very good at writing, learning out, can automate things that people can do. Um or even launching the first moocs massive open online courses that later led to Coursera, I was trying to automate what could be automat in how I was teaching on campus process of"
