  "Text": "you do it? So, most important thing is to get started. I think in the early part of a career coursework, um like the specialization is a very efficient way master this material. Uh So because, you know, instructors uh be it me or someone else or, you know, Lawrence Moroni teaches our tens of specialization or other things we're working on, spend effort to try to make a time efficient for you to learn a new concept of coursework was actually a very efficient way for people to learn concepts at the beginning. Parts of break into new feel. In fact, one thing I see at Stanford, uh some of my phd students want to jump into research right away and I actually tend to say, look in your first couple years of phd student, spend time taking courses uh because it lays the foundation is fine. If you're less productive in your first couple of years, you'd be better off in the long term. Beyond a certain point, there's materials that doesn't exist in courses because it's still cutting edge. The course has been created yet, there's some practical experience that we're not yet that good at teaching in a, in a course. And I think after exhausting the efficient coursework, then most people need to go on to uh either ideally work on projects and then maybe also continue their learning by reading blog polls and research papers and things like that. Um Doing process is really important. again, I think it's important to start small and just do something today you read about deep learning if you like, oh, all these people are doing such exciting things. What if I'm not building a neural network that changed the world? And what's the point? Well, the point is sometimes building that tiny neural network, you know, be it MS or upgrade to fashion MS to, to whatever doing your own fun hobby project. That's how you gain the skills to let you do bigger and bigger projects. find this to be true at the individual level and also at the organizational level for a company to become good at machine learning. Sometimes the right thing to do is not to tackle the giant project is instead to do the small project that lets the organization learn and then build out from there. But this is true both for individuals and, and, and for, and for companies"
