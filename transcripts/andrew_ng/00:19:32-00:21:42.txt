  "Text": "many people see is how hard it was. Uh So Peter and Adam Morgan Quigley and I were working on various versions of the helicopter and a lot of things did not work. For example, turns out one of the hardest problems we had was when the helicopters flying around upside down, doing stunts. How do you figure out the position? How do you localize a helicopter? So we want to try all sorts of things. Having one GPS unit doesn't work because you're flying upside down GP SS units facing down. So you can't see the satellites. we tried um we, we, we experimented trying to have two GPS units, one facing up, one facing down. So if you flip over that didn't work because the downward facing one couldn't synchronize if you're flipping quickly. Um Morgan quickly was exploring this crazy complicated configuration of specialized hardware to interpret GPS signals, look into FPG is completely insane, about a year working on that um didn't work. So I remember Peter great guy, him and me, you know, sitting down in my office looking at some of the latest things we had tried that didn't work and saying, you know, done it like what now because because we tried so many things in it and it just didn't work. Um in the end what we did Adam Cole was, was crucial to this was put cameras on the ground and use cameras on the ground to localize the helicopter. And that solved the localization problem so that we could then focus on the reinforcement learning and inverse learning techniques. So didn't actually make the helicopter fly. Um And you know, I'm reminded when, when I was doing this work at Stanford around that time, there was a lot of reinforcement learning theoretical papers, but not a lot of practical applications. the autonomous helicopter work for flying helicopters was one of the few, you know, practical applications of reinforcement learning at the time, which which caused it to become pretty well known. Um I I feel like we might have almost come full circle where today there's so much, so much hype, so much excitement about reinforcement learning. the game we're hunting for more applications and all of these great ideas that the community has come up with.
