  "Text": "think the thing that affects your experience more is less. Um Are you in this company versus that company or academia versus industry? I think the thing that affects your experience most is who are the people you're interacting with in a, in a daily basis. um even if you look at some of the large companies, the experience of individuals in different teams is very different. And what matters most is not the logo above the door. When you walk into the giant building every day, what matters the most is who are the 10 people who are the 30 people you interact with every day? So I tend to advise people. Um If you get a job from a, from a company, ask who is your manager, who are your peers? Who are you actually going to talk to? We're all social creatures, we tend to, you know, become more like the people around us. uh if you're working with great people, you will learn faster. Or if you get admitted, if you get a job at a great company or a great university, maybe the logo, you walk in, you know, is great, but you're actually stuck in some team doing really work that doesn't excite you. Uh And then that's actually really bad experience. So this is true both for um universities and for large companies, for small companies, you can kind of figure out who you'll be working with quite quickly. I tend to advise people if a company refuses to tell you who you work with, someone, say, oh join us, the rotation system, we'll figure it out. I think that that's a worrying answer because it, because it means you may not get sense to, you may not actually get to a team with, with great peers and great people to work with."
