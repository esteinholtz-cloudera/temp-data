  "Text": "know, if, if you take self driving cars, um the biggest problem with self driving cars is not that there's some trolley dilemma and you teach this. So you know, how many times when you are driving your car, did you face this moral dilemma? Who do I, who do I trash into? So I think driving cars will run into that problem roughly as often as we do when we drive our cars. Um, the biggest problem with self driving cars is when there's a big white truck across the road and what you should do is break and not crash into it and the self driving car fails and it crashes into it. So I think we need to solve that problem for, I think the problem with some of these discussions about um A G I, know, alignments, the paper clip problem uh is that is a huge distraction from the much harder problems that we actually need to address today. Some hard problems need address today. I think um bias is a huge issue. Um I worry about wealth and equality. The A I and internet are causing an acceleration of concentration of power because we can now uh centralized data use A I to process it. And so industry after industry will affect every industry. the internet industry has a lot of winner, take most of winner, take all dynamics but with infected all these other industries. So we also giving these other industries win. They take most of when they take all flavors. So look at what um Uber and Lyft did to the taxi industry. So we're doing this type of things, a lot of so this, so we're creating tremendous wealth. But how do we make sure that the wealth is fairly shared? I think that uh uh and, and how do we help people whose jobs are displaced? You know, I think education is part of it. There may be even more that we need to do than education. Um uh I think bias is a serious issue. Uh There are averse uses of A I like deep fakes being used for various nefarious purposes. So I worry about uh some teams maybe accidentally and I hope not deliberately a lot of noise about things that problems in the distant future rather than focusing on senses of much harder problems."
