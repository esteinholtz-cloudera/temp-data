  "Text": "published a document called the A I Transformation Playbook that's online and taught briefly in the A I for everyone calls on Coursera about the long term journey that companies should take. But the first step is actually to start small. Um I've seen a lot more companies fail by starting too big than by starting too small. Um Take even Google, you know, most people don't realize how hard it was and how controversial it was in the early days. when I started the Google Brain, um it was controversial. You know, people thought deep learning neurones tried, it didn't work. Why would you want to do deep learning? So my first internal customer within Google was the Google speech team, which is not the most lucrative project in Google. Uh not the most important, it's not web search or advertising, but by starting small, um my team helped speech team build a more accurate speech recognition system and this caused their peers, other teams to start to have more faith and deep learning. My second internal customer was uh the Google Maps team where we use computer vision to read house numbers from basic street view images to more accurately locate houses with Google Maps to improve the quality of GEO data. And it was only after those two successes that I then started the most serious conversation with the Google ads team."
