Cash app allows you to buy Bitcoin. Let me mention that Cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating. I recommend a cent of money as a great book on this history, and credits on ledgers started over 30,000 years ago. The US dollar was created over 200 years ago. And Bitcoin, the first decentralized Cryptocurrency released just over 10 years ago. So given that history, Cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development, but is still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money. again, if you get cash app from the App Store or Google Play and use the Code Lex podcast, you'll get $10 and cash app will also donate $10 to first one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and education for young people around the world. now here's my conversation with Andrew, courses you taught on machine learning at Stanford and later on Coursera that you co-founded have educated and inspired millions of people. So let me ask you what people are ideas, inspired you to get into computer science and machine learning when you were young. did you first fall in love with the field is another way to put it"
