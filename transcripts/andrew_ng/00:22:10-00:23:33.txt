If I feel that the work I do will influence people have positive impact or help someone. I remember when uh many years ago I was speaking with a mathematics professor and it kind of just said, hey, why do you do what you do? And, and, and he said, he, he, he actually, you know, he had stars in his eyes when he answered and this mathematician not from Stanford different University. He said I do what I do because it helps me to discover truth and beauty in the universe. He has stars in his eyes. And he said, and I thought that's great. Um don't want to do that.

I don't think everyone should do things the same way as I do.

That that's"
