  "Text": "interesting thing that I don't understand is that um that non cis people seem to have more correlation between childhood experiences and fetishes. So I was saying that there's no correlation between childhood experiences of ass this holds for cis people, but trans people, especially trans men, there's a correlation. It doesn't mean they have absolutely higher rates of abuse or fetishes or anything. I'm just saying that like for them, there does actually seem to be some sort of connection between childhood experiences and sexuality later in life. And I don't understand why this applies to one group but not the other. I don't have a good theory for that."
