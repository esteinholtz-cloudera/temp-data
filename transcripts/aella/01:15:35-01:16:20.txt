  "Text": "also if there's ways to design a survey that gets at the, at the victims of sex trafficking also, which is they presumably have public access to the internet. And I wonder how many of them are distinctly aware that they're victims. Like it's asking the question you're inside of a toxic relationship, are you inside of a toxic relationship? I mean, if, if the toxic relationship is truly toxic, sometimes your, your mind is fucked with, right? You're not, you don't even know what's true.
