  "Text": "I'm like, so what I need to do is I need to ask people a question like, are you like bondage? And if you say yes, then, then I'll go ask you all the bondage questions, right? But then this seems simple, but then it's just exploded because I'm like, how do I categorize these fetishes? if you're into splashing, which is like you like sitting in cakes, you like getting in mud but basically like kind of messy sensory like, is this a disgusting? Is it a humiliation thing? Is it a sensory thing? Like which category anyway? So it took me like two months of just agonizing over each fetish because you don't want to miss a fetish. You don't want to have a really important thing that you accidentally put in the discuss category when it actually belongs in the humiliation category. You know?"
