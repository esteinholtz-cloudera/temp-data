  "Text": ". Just so actually a long time ago, did a survey on SH versus LSD. So I asked people and people had slightly stronger experiences on LSD. Overall. I remember but rated the experiences about is equally good. think people like Shrooms because it feels more natural, quote unquote. But I think if you like fed somebody a shroom and actually had the LSD molecule in it, they would have, they would think it felt very natural. But that's beside the point. I like I think people get kind of incoherent on LSD in a way that feels really alienating. Like I consider LSD my LSD use very heavy to be one of the best decisions I ever made in my life. But I definitely was incoherent for a lot of it. Like talking about like we're all one consciousness, everything is love, man, you know, and people are like that inherent. I think it's not incoherent. But if you go around saying everything is love, people are like this guy's kind of blasted out of his mind. This"
