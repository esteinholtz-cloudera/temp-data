  "Text": ", I just think I had a good reaction and I think a lot of maybe the negative stereotype of LSD comes from people who are belief, constructing or carry the belief, constructing off of the LSD trip. So you take LSD and you're like, ah, I'm believing these insane things and people from the outside see that and they're like, oh my God, this person took LSD and became stupid. It's very scary."
