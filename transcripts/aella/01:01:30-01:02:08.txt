  "Text": "so this was most of that emotional processing for me. And I took me a couple of years from leaving home and all of that conservative culture into doing sex work. And in the meantime, I was, I did try having sex with a lot of people, but this was mainly because I didn't know what the norms were. I didn't really understand. I was just like, ok, take things logically, take things one step at a time. I'm like, ok, if the whole previous set about, like, how I'm not supposed to kiss somebody until the altar of marriage, if that's not the way that things are supposed to go, then what is the way things are supposed to go? And I was like, well, if I am aroused, I should go have sex with someone, right? Is there any reason not to? No? So I, I just, I would go around asking random people to have sex with me."
