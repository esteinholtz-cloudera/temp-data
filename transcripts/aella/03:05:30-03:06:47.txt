  "Text": "like overfitting the narratives that you make about the world become really vivid and so you pattern match just really aggressively like everything is connected and you come up with these explanations for things. And I think I was very fortunate. So I have like this theory about psychedelics where you either belief construct or you don't. So you take psychedelics and of like burns away a lot of your belief structure. Um And sometimes this happens and then you're like, I need to invent something to fill in the gaps. So you're like, OK, I think that maybe time is an illusion. So I must now believe that like, we're actually in a time loop or like time travel is possible. So you experience time differently and then you come up with a different belief about time. other people don't do this belief construction at all. Like you experience time differently and you sort of let yourself not have a belief. You're not like, ok, and you're not developing any beliefs about time in its absence, you're just simply experiencing the absence of the concept of time. And so I don't have a lot of data to back this up in my anecdotal experience because I've tripped out a lot of people, people either tend to belief construct or they don't people who do not believe construct seem to get more out of their LSD trips. So if you can let a belief go without building anything in its absence, um It's much more beneficial for you. And I think I just, for some reason, happen to have some brain that's constructed where I don't get a belief construction at all. So"
