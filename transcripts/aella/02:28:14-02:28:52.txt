  "Text": "relationships, I love it when people do not reassure me, I like not being comforted quite a lot. so usually the people I date don't, I'm very gravitating. It's one of the things people do to make me fall in love with them is if I say something really terrible and they're just like, do not give me any comfort whatsoever. That's where my heart gets captured. So I typically am in relationships where I'm like, oh man, I'm so jealous and they just do not reassure me at all and that's good because it doesn't give you. mean, I have to deal with it myself. Like, maybe it is true that the other woman is better than me. Maybe that is an actual possible reality. And I don't want to be dealing with my life in a way where I'm pretending I'm only ok when that reality is not"
