  "Text": "don't know. There's a way of looking at things where it's like, for example, the childhood fetish thing that I was talking about, like, where do your fetishes come from? Like you can develop a narrative where it's like, you know, I think like this kind of thing is, you know, when you're surrounded by feet, when you're a child, this costs foot fetishes. And this is like kind of a cool narrative. Uh And I think a lot of people's ideas about philosophy follow the same sort of thing. Like what is the narrative that is cool? And I think this is useful for meaning making. Like I'm very pro meaning making. Like when you're talking about everything is fun because you know, the contrast or whatever, I very much just ascribe to that, I really enjoy that, that philosophy. I also find everything to be very delightful. and this isn't like a question of truth, right? We're not like where is the true delight that we're objectively measuring? Like this is a frame, a poetic frame that you're using to like sort of change the way the light hits the world around you. And that's super useful because it like makes you happier or something."
