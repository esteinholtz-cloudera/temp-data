  "Text": "was really fucked up. Like after I left home and I absorbed the external narrative that I had been abused, which technically is true. I'm not saying I wasn't, but like I absorbed this narrative and I just remember had like this burning coals in my chest at all times. Like if I had to call out of my factory work when father's day happened because I was spending the whole day sobbing because everybody was talking about their fathers. I was really messed up. And it's because I held this important thing, this idea, this frame that I had been deeply wronged. Like there was a correct way of being and the world had violated that something should not have happened. Like my father should have loved me. And it was like this, this like, like the shearing in the nature of reality. And that was really agonizing to have and LSD really messes with frames a lot. It takes like what you think is normal and really screws with it. I done LC like several times before. But there's one LSD trip where I remember I went through my entire childhood in my head because LSD like really makes your memories quite vivid, like anything you visualize, it's like you're in it. so I just went and very carefully, deliberately went and remembered every single memory that I could have. That was really painful for me. Like the times that I lost friends and all the things I valued and like being broken because like my parents, especially my dad would refer to like breaking me like explicit, they're going to break your will as all these times where I was like they had successfully broken my will over and over and it was horrible. I was just like sobbing, tears streaming down my face and then I like work through my whole child. I got to the end I'm going to tear up because every time we talk about this, it's just like the sensation of like being free from that for the first time is so incredible. Like I remember being outside of my house and being able to like, go where I wanted and think what I wanted. And uh it was just so blissful and I was soaked in this gratitude on this trip, just vibrating with complete joy for everything. I was just looking at like I could touch anything I could cry if I wanted to, I wasn't allowed to cry. I was going to be depressed. I got depressed as a child. And my parents were like, if you keep being depressed, we're going to force you to scrub the whole house just the ability to have a feeling uh was so thrilling and I was so grateful for this. I was like, I would do anything to give this experience to someone else. I would do anything if it was like putting them through what I went through. And then with that realization, I was like, oh, it was worth it. The thing that I went through was worth it for this. I would do it again to be able to have this deep gratitude for what I have now and then that shifted the meaning frame because before the meaning had been something had sheared, something that shouldn't have happened. But now it was like the exact right thing had happened. So, it's almost a gift. Yeah. I was like, ah, I would not give up my childhood. I would do it again. I believe that to this"
