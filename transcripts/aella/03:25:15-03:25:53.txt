  "Text": "bit like in the same way you express agency when you eat LSD, like the only thing you actually do in eating LD is like put the tab in your mouth and then you just kind of scream the whole way after that. But there's a lot of other things like I didn't feel powerful enough to like go make events happen or anything. it was this guy, uh he had a lot of agency in the sense that he would just sort of create realities through the people around him be like, OK, we're going to do this start up or we're going to throw this incredible event like let's just do it and it would somehow happen and it was really cool to see that. so that one thing led to another and it was one of the biggest impacts on my life I think."
