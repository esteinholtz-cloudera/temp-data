Like romance is a fuck you to the way the world works. Really? Yeah. Like, it's a, like Romeo and Juliet romance. Like description of what romance looks like versus, like, there's like a million variations of that. But in my, in my head, like this partnership that's for a long time together is a kind of, you know, like, I don't know, like true romance. You know, that movie, it's a really fucking good movie. Ok.
