  "Text": "have a lot of incentive to doubt the results. Like a lot of the research I'm doing is to like sis and trans people like, we don't have any data about transsexual, like, not very good, at least. Um And I'm really curious, I don't really have an it. I think like, being trans is cool if you want to be trans, do it. And like, I have some skepticism about gender theory but it doesn't come down to impact like, the way I think trans people should be treated, which I think is like, treat them, you know, be fucking nice and human about it. I don't know. But when I'm talking about the thing, like my conclusions are that like transsexual is really unique. It's not like like sister is this woman or man sexuality at all? And to me this is super cool. But a lot of people, this is very politicized right now, like the data into transsexual preferences, it's so loaded, which is really sad because I am very accepting of weird sexuality. If you're into a weird thing, I'm like, good for you. This is super cool. Let's figure out how to make it so that you can explore the thing you're into without any stigma. because there's so much stigma that like if you find that one demographic isn't a weirder sex stuff than the other. Like, it's hard to present that in a way that people don't weaponize. So it's been, it's been really politically touchy subject here. Yeah."
