I don't, it's difficult for me to work on projects that are not my projects. Uh so I was like, hey, fuck it. Like I want to go back to sex work. I want to make more money, but I don't want to cam anymore because I'm burned out. So I'm like, well, let's try. I had a friend who's an escort. I'm like, let's try that. And so we had a call.
