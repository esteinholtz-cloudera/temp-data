  "Text": "is I might go into way too much detail about this because I thought about this so much because the question is, how do you get a lot of people to take a big survey? The longer the survey is the lower the response rate. And I really wanted to do one big comprehensive survey. So I could check a whole bunch of correlations with it within it it's more annoying and it's harder to get a lot of people to retake similar surveys to each other at a time. So I'm like, OK, I need to convince a very large number of people to take a lot of these questions and even building the questions. That was really hard because I'm like, OK, I need a comprehensive amount of fetishes. I can't ask everybody to answer for every single niche fetish. I'm like, do you like ball gags? Do you like funnel gags? Do you like wife shrew gags or whatever? like, you can't do that. Nobody's going to finish that survey."
