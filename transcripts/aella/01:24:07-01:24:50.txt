  "Text": "like? So with only with my free cams, I was unusual in that I decided to do outside of the website marketing. I would like post on Reddit, right? This was very unusual at the time, but like only fans are structured such that they have almost no internal discovery whatsoever. So if you want people to come to your page, you have to go out on the external websites and advertise for yourself directly, different model. And so this is something I had already been doing, it already had practice in. And so I think I was already quite advanced, like I already had an account on Reddit that was like seven years old at the time, tons of like karma. That means I could post in subreddits. I had already been on Twitter for years, you know, like posting actively. So I already had like presences on all these other platforms that really helped with the conversion, reddit and Twitter, Reddit, Twitter felt life Instagram"
