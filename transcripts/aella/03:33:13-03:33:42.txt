  "Text": ", people are way more judgmental of women. I haven't experiences personally in my circles because I'm in very sex friendly circles. Like I'm in orgy circles where everybody like dates the same women and they're like whoa, good job. Uh But yeah, people are much more like people always tell me online like you're not even going to be able to find a husband because you have sex with too many people. It's very common, which I don't think, I mean, like men are also perceived negatively if you have high body count, but I think I don't think it's negatively in the same way. Yeah, do"
