  "Text": "time. I mean, obviously it wasn't perfect because it's the internet. But don't know, this, this, this is the thing that confuses me a lot because a lot of women that I know complain about being harassed by men quite a lot. They're like, you know, men are always, you know, grope and harass, you know, you have to be paranoid in the club. People are like, they're always coughing on you and you're like, Jesus Christ, get away men. And I do not have this experience or like, maybe I do, but I'm interpreting it differently. I don't know. The thing is, I don't know what causes me to have such a different experience from these women that are like really really hostile towards men. And my guess is that there's some sort of like very subtle signaling that we're accidentally doing like no fault of our own. I'm not saying this is a virtue. I'm saying like, maybe it's just genetic or the fact that I think women are doing that the women are doing. Yeah, like that. And it might be just something I'm completely accidentally through no intention. Like having to signal the thing that is causing men to not view me as like a desirable target or like a target at all.
