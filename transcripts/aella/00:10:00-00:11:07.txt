  "Text": ". I think it works on a lot of people from the outside. You're like, ah, the scientists with the white lab coats with credentials. Those are the people who are doing science and doing science is, you know, you have like, fancy terms that other people don't really understand to be fair, like I, I have a lot to learn. I'm still like, I'm self teaching. I'm like learning through people learning as I go, I'm definitely not super knowledgeable about this stuff. Um But a lot of what those people are doing in science is not that hard. Um And a lot of people like, don't try to learn it because it seems so like elevated. this is one thing that really bothers me. I think like everybody can do science. Like if you just have this aspect of curiosity and like, you just really want to figure something out. You can go and start, you know, asking people questions, doing surveys, like writing down the answers and then you can go learn how to look at that data in a way that gives you more information about the world. Like it's very simple and straightforward if you just approach it humbly and earnestly and you're like, please, let's let's figure this out together. But people like, I think self crippled in this because uh they view this as like to the domain of the experts and, you know, the fancy scientists. And I think that makes me feel really sad."
