  "Text": "fun because it's like, I mean, yeah, heartbreak is like knowing that I'm capable of that. It, it, it like from,, you know, we're, we're all living in the gutter, but some of us are, are looking up at the stars. So when you're in that gutter, some reason, the stars look brighter, right? Like, so, like whenever you're going through a difficult time whenever you see, maybe other people being shitty to each other, it makes you, like, really appreciate when they're not. The contrast makes life kind of amazing. I'm reading a bunch of books and one of them is brave new world where they remove con you know, where they remove the ups and downs of life, um partially through drugs, but over, over sexualization and all that kind of stuff. And feel like you need con you need the ups and downs of life, uh the dark, you know, you need the dark to have happiness, have like a deeply intense feeling of affection towards another thing or a human being. Yeah. Yeah. So everything is fun but fun is also a weird word to define because fun, I think for a lot of people in got that's why I talk about love a lot. I, I think, I think love is a better word than fun fun is like lighthearted. is more intense. Like I love that glass and the water that's in it because it's freaking awesome. Like somebody made that glass, right? Like they and like not have many mistakes and like there's a and the way bends light in interesting ways and the way water bends light in interesting ways, like I can see part of your arm through that water. freaking amazing. Everything is amazing. with the LEGO movie anyway. Um If, but if like from a scientific perspective, if I were to investigate sex, don't know why I put love in there. Let's, let's narrow down the Twitter poll. Let's focus on the basics here. Sex, power or death, immortality. I were to try to from a neuroscience neurobiology perspective or reverse engineer for building A I systems that focus on these kinds of dynamics, exploring the game theoretic aspects of it, exploring sort of cognitive modeling aspects of it. Which one would get me to a deeper understanding of the human condition. the question. Sex. OK. Nietzsche is the will to power um Freud and, and, and the bunch is all about sex and then um death uh live just uh live burly previous guest on this podcast. She just released a video where on her bedside was the book Denial of Death Ernest Becker, which of course she would have on her bedside. But that his whole work is that everything is motivated by our trying to escape the cold, harsh reality that we're going to die and we're terrified of it. One of the gifts and burdens human beings is that we are cognizant of our own death. And that terrifies us. That's the theory. And because of that we do everything we can, we build, we build empires to escape the fact that we're mortal."
