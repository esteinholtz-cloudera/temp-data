  "Text": "I, well, I left home like kind of early um because my, my dad and I were not getting along by the time I was a teenager. Um But I still Christian for a while and I lost my faith after I think I moved it away and I started having friends that weren't religious or like, weren't raised in the super conservative environment that I came from. And I think this was not conscious at the time. This is my hindsight story. But I believe that being exposed to a culture in which I had the capacity to believe, like allowed my brain to actually seriously consider the thought that maybe all of this stuff was untrue that I've been taught like 6000 year old earth. And evolution is a lie, you know, macro evolution and all of this stuff because like, when you're, when you're immersed in an environment like that, I don't think you actually have a choice. Like, your brain has to believe these things because this is a survival thing. Like, if you believe this, you'll be like, if you believe the wrong thing, you'll be totally cast out. if they're not going to cast you out, you're going to be cast out in like communion with others because we were always told that you can't like, trust nonbelievers really. They don't have a moral compass, they're going to screw you over. And so I'm like, oh, I can't be that like, everybody's going to outcast me internally. So anyway, I wasn't, I don't think I actually had the capacity to seriously question my faith even though I thought that I was questioning it quite hard until I got into an environment where it was safe to do so. And once I started being able to make friends who were not religious, I'm like, oh, if I lose my faith, I'm still going to have some sort of community. And then at that time I, I went through some questioning and then I lost my faith. And"
