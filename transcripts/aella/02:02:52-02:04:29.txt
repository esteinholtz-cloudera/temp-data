  "Text": "lot of it is just a, a feeling like an amorphous fear, failure. it would actually look like. because we're talking about sexuality. Me not being able to eloquently explain the world view I have and why I appreciate appreciate it. would make me feel like a failure because that would make me feel like maybe you don't know what you're doing, right? Because sex, sex, sexuality and not sexuality, which is even romantic relationships are really important to happiness, to they're really important to me. And I'm not sure like the conception of love I have romantic love is like fully um rigorous. So especially when I'm talking to you that thinks very rigorously about a lot of these topics. I don't, I'm not sure if I've thought about them a lot. I feel them. I interact with the world in the space of feelings. I'm almost afraid to be very rigorous with these kinds of thoughts. And so I think the failure would be like, I would be confronted with the fact that I can't explain makes me happy. That could be a failure and that could be just a bunch of other failures. Another big failure is like uh not, I think you're a really brilliant person. And a lot of folks I know, know and admire your work as well. And so, like, for me not to be part of highlighting that brilliance would be a failure. Definitely,"
