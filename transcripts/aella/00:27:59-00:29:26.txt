  "Text": "is consciousness is like one of the biggest questions ever? I think I do think that people often get confused when talking about consciousness because I think people are referring to two separate concepts and often like combining them into one thing. Like we asked the question, you know, is a I going to be conscious? I think this is kind of the wrong question. Like like, like we can identify signs of consciousness, like, ah they seem to refer to themselves, but this is not necessarily proof of consciousness in the same way that like dream characters acting exactly the way normal human do people do in your dream is not evidence that they themselves are conscious. So like signs of consciousness are not proof of consciousness, but there is something that we definitely know, which is like, I currently am conscious, I can tell because, I'm just directly observing my experience. And so there's one kind of consciousness which is I am directly observing my experience and that you cannot replicate it. I cannot observe two experiences. It is necessarily singular and it is necessarily certain, like you can make all the arguments you want. I'm still directly observing, it's not a thing that's subject to reason. Whereas are other things conscious, this is something that's replicable, like you can apply it to multiple people. Um It's something that's not certain uh like almost definition, not certain. Like we don't actually know if there is, you know, an internal experience. So my argument is that like when are talking about other things, having experience, they're using a different concept than the thing that they're actually looking at. When they look at their own experience, I think they're two different things."
