  "Text": "be a naive version of interpreting this where you're just like, oh, I'm trying to like subtly get you to, you know, believe like, oh, do you really think that's bad though? But this is not quite what I mean. I mean, there's like a couple of concrete things that are signs of frame control, like one of them is pushing the painful update button, which is this thing where it's like,, if you learn this, it's going to be really painful. The truth is painful. And if you're realizing this thing about yourself, it's going to hurt and this is a sign that you're heading in the right direction. So if you frame all pain as a sign of virtue, then this means that pain that's resulting as damage is something you're going to ignore. So it's like this, it's a common occult, right? This is for your own good. Oh You know, you face a brave truth about yourself that you're not quite as wise as I am. when really your brain might be trying to tell you protected things or like another one is like finger trap beliefs where the belief is constructed in such a way that doubting it lends proof to the belief. a very common example is Satan, the Christians are like, Satan is going to try to make you doubt him the existence of he's going to so doubt maybe he's not actually real. And so if you believe in Satan and then you're like, ok, now I'm having doubts, maybe he isn't real. This is like, oh, this is exactly what I was taught to expect. I am doubting this belief because I was told this is what Satan does and it's taken this evidence for it. So the attempt to move away from the belief like rebounds on you and causes you to be more embedded inside of the belief. So it's like techniques like these like very subtle things where being inside of the system, sort of just self reinforces the system is what I consider to be frame control."
