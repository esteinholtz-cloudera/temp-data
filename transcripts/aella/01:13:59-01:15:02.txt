  "Text": ". There's a method that I'm trying that I really like, I designed a survey type which is like asking people who, you know, like who do you know who's done this? And you tell me like, oh, do you know anybody who's a doctor? Do you know anybody who you know, has had cancer or like smokes or? Yeah, personally, just do you know anybody? And then if you ask about a whole bunch of things, you can calibrate the responses. like if your, if your population, you know 20% of them know doctors and then you know the actual amount of doctors, then you can tell like how this is corresponding like what is the visibility of doctors? So you can reconstruct the graph basically. Yeah, and we can do this with sex traffic and of course people are going to be like, well, sex trafficking is not visible people. You don't know those like, well, then we can ask about other non visible things that other people don't know that we do have data for like homelessness or being in jail like, if you have been like, sexually assaulted, a lot of people don't like talking about if they've been sexually assaulted. So, you know, a whole bunch of things that are like similarly suppressed in knowledge in some way that we do actually have rates for and then compare that to the graph when we ask people, do you know anybody who's in sex traffic? So again, this is not perfect. I'm not saying this is"
