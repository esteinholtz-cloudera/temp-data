  "Text": ", I'm trying to get people into the right question set sure, because like I can't ask you all the questions. I have to ask you a couple overarching questions to know what specific questions to ask you. so I have to, those overarching questions have to be really, really well calibrated so that I can accurately feed you into the right sub part of the survey. And so that was extremely difficult if I'm, when I'm dealing with, I think it was like 850 fetishes. So I did a couple of things to spot check. I like, I did a couple of questions where I asked um like in the detailed in the survey, but like also the beginning of the survey just to see like what percentage of people I was capturing. Um but, and then, and then I scored the survey. So if you take it, I had other people answer preliminary surveys where they gave me data about how taboo the various fetishes were. then I use that data so that when you fill out the survey, it's extremely comprehensive and you get data about exactly how t your interests are and you get a score at the end and I give you an equivalent kinky character, which I also had people write a whole bunch of fictional characters and some historic ones about like how Kinky they were. So I matched the character, Kiki character to your score."
