  "Text": ". Yeah. Try school. Had to drop off a couple of months and then I was like, well, I'm poor and uh I was, I was ready to take any job. I was like, applying for sewer jobs. And then I got a factory. I'm like, because my parents know no financial help at all. They're like, you pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, you know. anyway, I went to work at a factory and that sucks ass. Do not recommend we work up, wake up like 4 a.m. you know, work on weekends too lights. It was terrible. And so I did that for about a year and I was like, this is I was trying to grit my teeth and be like, this is my life, right? I didn't have high expectations for my life. I was just like, I thought like if you get a job where you don't have to be on your feet all the time, that's that you're living a good life. But and then I got another job briefly as a photographer and then they fired me. I think I was 19 at the time was, I was too young and really, really bad at interacting with people in the outside world. Like I was pretty well socialized as a homeschooler with other homeschoolers. But in the outside world, especially with all of the like hierarchy, submission stuff beaten into me like literally beaten into me. It was very difficult for me to interact with other people who were like older than me or had any sort of confidence at all., so they hired me to do like photography for people and then I was rapidly turned out that I was bad at this. And so they fired me. But at that point I left my factory job. I'm like, I can't go back to the factory. So I tried, I had some savings and I slept on friends' couches and I tried various self employment stuff. I'm like, oh, maybe I can do product photography or but it's Idaho, you know, nothing. And if you're like a night with no experience in the outside world at all, it was really difficult. And so I had a friend recommend that I try becoming a camgirl. So that's how it started. What,"
