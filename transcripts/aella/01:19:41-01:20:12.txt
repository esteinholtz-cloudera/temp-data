  "Text": "once had a homeless guy asked me to come back to my place baby and I was like, this is fun. I'm like, do you want me to, I love asking men. Like, are you trying to get me to have sex with you just saying it out front and they'll be like, well, little bit. They usually they stop for a minute. They're like, well, uh yeah, I mean, I would like to have sex and they'll be like, thanks for asking, but I'm not interested in having sex with you. Hope you have a good day and then I walk away that's great. I don't know. I have no issues with that interaction, but maybe this is the kind of thing that other women would find to be really offensive."
