  "Text": "were more correct in their prediction predicting women and women were that women are more off. Women thought men cheated much less than they actually did. And, but of them were off, but like the male gap was significantly more. So, yeah, I mean, you're right when you say monogamy is not default, like I think you're like really getting at something like human beings are just especially in long term relationships, difficult only want one person but to be fair. I think Minami and commitment are very different. I think you'd be incredibly, I've known so many very long term super committed poly couples that live lives that look very similar to the very romantic monogamous couples like Children houses, like 20 years and that works great for them."
