  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Ayla, a sex researcher who does some of the largest human sexuality survey studies in the world on everything from fetishes to relationships. She is fearless in pursuing her curiosity on these topics by asking challenging and fascinating questions and looking for answers in a rigorous data driven way and writing about it on her blog knowing less.com. also a sex worker including only fans and escorting and is an exceptionally prolific creator of thought provoking Twitter polls. and I disagree on a bunch of things, but that just made this conversation even more interesting. I like interesting people in the full range of the meaning that the word interesting implies. currently reading on the Road by Jack Kerouac and would be remiss if I didn't mention one of my favorite quotes from that book that feels relevant here. only people for me are the mad ones. The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk mad to be saved, desirous of everything. At the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle, you see the blue center like pop and everybody goes now a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description is the best way to support this podcast. We got House of Macadamia for healthy midday snacks.

But if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will too. show is brought to you by probably our most delicious sponsor. sponsor that has given me a tremendous month of happiness and joy. Simple joy, sitting alone on a couch in a podcast room, just eating macadamia snacks. ship delicious, high quality and healthy macadamia nuts directly to your door. Anyway, this thing is delicious. It's healthy, 30% less carbs than almonds. It's the only nut of the many nuts. And I've researched this, but they've also told me is reached in Omega sevens. Professor Tim Noakes who I should probably talk to at some point sings Macadamia oil praises. There's so much to say that's awesome. The thing is, it's just delicious. It's portioned perfectly. It brings happiness, get it. Maybe it'll bring you happiness and we can just telepathically enjoy these thoughts together. to House of academia.com/lux to get 20% off your order for every order. Not just the first our listeners that's you will also get a four ounce bag of macadamias when you order three or more boxes of any macadamia product. That's House of academia.com/lex. show is also brought to you by athletic greens and its A G one drink which is an all in one daily drink to support better health and peak performance. It too is freaking delicious and it too is a source of a lot of happiness every day, twice a day. In fact, I'm not religiously bringing in on the road with me, the travel packs I like to bring the happiness with me. It's actually really stressful for me to travel as it is for a lot of people. This is a recent discovery for me. One of the things that kind of makes it a lot better if I bring little trinkets that remind me of home or little habits that remind me of home or little food items and so on. And athletic greens is that I bring element electrolyte and athletic greens with me on the road and it just reminds me of home athletic greens. That's where I start the day with in terms of breaking my fast and I put it in the fridge it's just, it's delicious. It's refreshing. It's just a great mental boost for me. They'll give you one month supply of fish when you sign up at Athletic greens.com/lex. show is also brought to you by inside tracker a service I use to track biological data. It's interesting because this conversation with Ayala is in fact about data. A lot of data, a lot of data from, I think she has over 500,000 people that took a very extensive survey on their sexual preferences and all that kind of stuff. So basically report information about your own understanding of your mind and body and so on. I mean, that's so powerful, that's so so so powerful. Data in general is really powerful for any kind of study for medical studies, for psychological studies, sociological, for any kind of study that includes humans. And it's nice to see Ayala do this gigantic data set, but to figure out what you need for your body, for your life, for your diet should not be based no matter how big the data set is, that should not be based on population data or it should only be in part based on population data. It should be hopefully in large part based on the data that comes from your own body. And that's what inside tracker is. One of the great folks that are taking a step forward in this thing that obviously represents the future, get special savings for a limited time when you go to Inside tracker.com/lex. is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends. Here's ala feel like this conversation can go anywhere. Is that exciting or terrifying to you? I think"
