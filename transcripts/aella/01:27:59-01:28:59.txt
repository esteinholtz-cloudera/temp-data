  "Text": ". The thing that I found was most successful were frames where the man was framed as passive and the woman is active or like example, like, oh, you know, we got assigned to the same bunk at the breeding school or something or like, oh, we're the last people on earth, right? Or like, oh no, you know, I I desperately need somebody to cure me with this disease and I need semen. it's like in any scenario where the guy just finds himself such that the woman desperately needs him for some reason and he doesn't have to do much. That is typically one of the much more successful things, guys like women falling into their lap. What about the power dynamic? Um So guys are less into power dynamics than women are and you can do power dynamics as long as it's handed to them. guys, obviously, some guys are like very dominant and like prefer like having to work. But this is the minority. Like if you're trying to do make 100 K a month and you're trying to appeal to the whitest group of people, the most effective advertising, you're not going to be making the most money by being particularly submissive."
