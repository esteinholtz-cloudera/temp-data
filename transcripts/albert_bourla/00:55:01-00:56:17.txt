  "Text": "never said something 100% that every time I speak, if a number is 100% I rush to say that in biology there is nothing 100% because always there will be when you go to the millions. OK? There were in the study, things that were 100% for example, deaths or in South Africa. When we tried, there was 100% clearly small numbers. When the numbers will become much bigger, the 100% will not hold but will be 9596. So still the direction of this is the point. So I'm very, very careful how I what I tweet and uh in addition to how careful I am, I have people that uh they are looking at and they are having second or third opinions to make sure that we don't put why? I know that people are listening to me right now, everything I say and I want to make sure that they continue not only, only being clear as to what I want to say. So there are no misunderstandings but also I maintain the trust of the people. I don't think that uh someone who only c picks information and only emphasizes for the things. It's someone that it is the one to be trusted. And I want me and Pfizer to be trusted."
