  "Text": "is something that um can lose in buckets, but you can earn back in drops. And um once you lost it, uh you are going to take a lot of effort to bring it back and the pharmaceutical industry lost it. It's clear that the reputation of the industry in the last decade was on the lowest that uh we have seen ever. And uh for there are many reasons for that, clearly there are reasons that are related also with the behavior of the industry needed to change. And I'm hopeful that uh few will disagree, but the industry is a very different industry right now. being said, truly believe that uh if there is one lesson that stands out from the main lessons that we learned during COVID the power of science in the hands of the private sector, think it was the private sector that came with solutions with diagnostic tests when we didn't have solutions with respirators, when we didn't have solutions with treatments, solutions with vaccines. I think that demonstrated very clearly to the world, the value of a thriving life sciences sector, private life sciences sector to society also affected very positively the reputation, both of the sector and of pfizer. not going to make the mistake to consider given I'm not make to make the mistake that because our occupation is high, that will remain. So we need to earn it every day, every day with everything we do with everything we say with the way we behave. And uh I hope that we will rise to this occasion and we will do that."
