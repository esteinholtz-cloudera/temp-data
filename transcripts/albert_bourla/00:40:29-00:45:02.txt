  "Text": "go, first of all, with uh smaller doses in humans. then after you have done a lot of experiments in animals so that you can feel that it is safe enough to go to humans and then go with very low dose and then you gradually increase the dose and then you monitor those humans to make sure that uh there are not any, let's say, reacts to what you are giving them. At the same time, you start to measure what is doing in terms of uh immune responses. you do that with multiple vaccines and you do that with multiple doses and you do that with multiple ages of people, young people, old people and um eventually uh from the 20 vaccines to multiple doses to multiple schedules. Is it after three weeks, the second dose or is it after four weeks or after six months? All of that will inform you. I think this is the vaccine, this is the dose, this is the scheme that I believe will give me the best results. And when you have that, then you go to do what we call the phase three. is a very big study. of people where you use the vaccine that you think is the right one and a placebo, the placebo and the vaccine, they look identical. Nobody knows if it's injected the placebo or vaccine, the physician that makes the injection. The doctor doesn't know if he's injecting placebo or vaccine. He knows a AAA barcode. Only the computer knows. order to go into this computer, there are keys and there are at least two people that needs to put their keys so that someone can see the data and there's those people, they have legal obligations never to do that. Right. So, before a certain point, so all of that is blind. The idea is that when you go into this study, uh you need to make sure that you are going with the right one. That's why it takes so many, so much time. But the study is the study, need to have a significant number of people that will give the two and then you let them live their lives and then you see how many of them will get the disease. And then you see if there are differences in percentage of infections for the vaccinated compared to the non vaccinated. At the same time, you are monitoring all of them to see if there are differences, the safety profile, if those that they go to placebo have the same, let's say heart attacks with those that they didn't, uh they got the vaccine because heart attacks will happen if you have 50,000 people. That because it's part of life, these are the, the all these process are very, very, very well established. And uh since years, what we did the last one was exactly the same as we did. Always, we just didn't lose time. didn't, we, we're not careful with money instead of uh recruiting 50,000 people over year because we had, let's say 30 hospitals doing the recruitment, we went with 100 and 50 hospitals doing the recruitment that cost a lot of money. But instead of recruiting them in a year, we recruited them in 34 months. So I did this type of things by taking return on investment, taking cost out of the equation. And we were able to achieve this result, but it's not the process. Believe me, it is the heart of the people. don't know what they can and what they cannot do. if anything, they have a serious tendency to underestimate what they can do. And always when you ask them something that is seemingly impossible, they will think out of the box to be able to deliver. discussed about the timing instead of eight years, we didn't ask them to do it. In six, we asked them to do it in eight months. Huh normal manufacturing production Pfizer was 200 million doses of vaccines every year. That was we are doing in the last 10 years. didn't ask them to make 300 million doses for a new vaccine. We asked them to make 3 billion doses for a new vaccine. discovery phase of a new molecule like the treatment that we have. Now the pill against COVID takes four years. We didn't ask them to do it in three. We asked them to do it in four months, which is what they did when you are setting this type of goals. They know immediately they, they cannot just think within the box and immediately this is where the human ingenuity in the heart comes and this is how they surprised all of us."
