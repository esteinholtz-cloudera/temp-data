  "Text": "is a virtue. Yes. And the fact that you are educated doesn't mean that you are having either humility or empathy or you have good uh human qualities. This was never and will never be a metric of judging this type of virtues. Those that they do this, wrong and actually they, they are not doing good service to the public health because they are undermining people are not stupid. They see if you are not uh be respecting them and if you are not respecting their need to learn because that affects their health, the health of the mother of the kids. So I fully agree with you that we should be very patient to explain again and again and again, is happening and the vast majority of the people that they don't get vaccinations right now is because they're afraid it's not for any other reason, it's not that they have uh an agenda. What I'm saying it is there is a small number of people that they have make business for them to profit from this anxiety. I'll give you an example. have been arrested by FBI. This is what someone wrote. I, I read it. I laughed. I mean, OK, this is where they take there was a reason why they wrote it that the pfizer co was arrested the FBI because they want to create doubts in the minds of the people that they're afraid and say, look, if FD I arrested him, likely I will not do the vaccine. But I laughed. A week later, wife of the Fo Seal. is a picture in the, in this website of my wife. sends to me. Now I'm pissed. I'm not laughing. I try to find my kids to tell them if you read something. Mom is fine. Don't worry. I remember that she has old parents back in Greece. We start calling them to making sure because so you know that that will be picked up by Greek newspapers and they will uh will publish it. OK? They are those people that wrote these things. They know very well that my wife didn't die and died because she, she was vaccinated, right? So this is the narratives that they are on purpose forming to profit from uh the stress and uh the anxiety of good people. And"
