  "Text": ", I know. But it's still, it's pressure, it's human nature. I mean, I, I was one of it is perception but I, I worry about it too. I think I have a ton of sponsors for this podcast, for example. And none of them ever asked me to anything. They're just, you know, I think likely that kind of pressure is not happening for pfizer, but there's implied pressure sometimes and I worry about that a lot because um you know, I look at academia II, I look for the good in people. I tend to believe most people are good or the capacity to be good and the desire to be good. Uh When I came to MIT, I, was a little bit um, maybe heartbroken much pressure I think unjustified pressure people felt from financial constraints, especially at MIT when there's, I think a lot of money, still felt constraints and they weren't, it wasn't bringing out the best of them, they weren't supporting each other, they weren't loving each other, like celebrating each other's successes. I don't want to blame money on everything, money constraints. But when you have sponsors, it just um I personally worried that it doesn't bring the best out of people. And so I feel like I want to put some responsibility on sponsors and, and great big companies pfizer to, to kind of um in the way of the best human nature, whether it's sponsoring uh podcasts, mainstream media, like, I don't know, athletes, whatever"
