  "Text": ". In the beginning when we had the first months of the vaccine, people would ask me, do we need another one? And I said, we don't know, I was very clear about it. Then around April, may I start seeing the first data? And I made statements that I think we will need a booster around 8 to 12 months after the second dose. And then after that annually vaccinations, this is what I said, is the one of the most likely scenario it was based on the data that they had. But then Delta came because I always making the, the the caveat that with absent a new variant, with everything we know with Delta, it was proven that we need the booster to move to the three to the six months. And this is what uh happened. And uh I still said, I think the booster is a six months. And then I think it will be an annual re vaccination like we have to monitor to see the data. But this is the likely scenario. Now we have o the Omran says that uh two doses might be challenging. We don't know exactly yet, but three doses work. So clearly, a lot of countries already started moving. Now, the third dose not in six, from six months to three. So that uh they will reduce the period that people will not be protected with uh with uh the third dose. Uh I don't know with omicron if how long will last. And frankly, I don't know if we will need a new vaccine tailor made to Omicron based on everything we know. So far we are monitoring and we will know way more in the weeks to come. If there is a need for a new vaccine, we will have it. if there is a need for mass production of this new vaccine, I can also feel very comfortable that we will not lose any of our capacity that we have developed right now, we are running at 1 billion, almost approximately doses per quarter four per year. And if we have two streets have half of that in the new half of that in the old, we will do still $4 billion. So I think the world should feel very, very comfortable. But if there is a need, we will be ahead of the virus."
