  "Text": "have zero doubts that this is not affecting at all their ability to be unbiased and regulate. And in order to, for the, the system also reinforces that by creating significant time barriers. If someone moves from an industry to FDA, she won't be able to deal with topics for a period of time and then for even an enhanced period of time with topics that are related with the company he or she may come from, think these um, regulators, they are very, very strict rightly. So if anything, I feel sometimes that maybe they should uh be a little bit more open minded, particularly when it comes to new technologies rather than trying to judge and implement the same framework of valuation of new technologies to all. They are always as regulators in the conservative side, but uh always, they are unbiased and they are trying uh the best and it's not only one or two people, they have processes to make sure that there are self sex and balances within the agencies, both in CDC and in the FDA difficult decisions, they bring external experts that they should express easy decisions. They are internal experts that they are debating a lot and if there are disagreements, they elevate them. So I think it's uh we are lucky to have regulators. I think I agree with what you said before. As with all governmental agencies, there is bureaucracy and the bureaucracy needs to be addressed. And by saying bureaucracy is not relaxing the, the bar, the bar needs to remain high. But uh being uh focusing on what matters rather than uh on the, on the detail."
