  "Text": "think it is uh a very difficult uh topic and a very difficult decision who whoever needs to make it and clearly, it's not me, it is the public health officials of every country that they have to make this decision. I have to make the decision for f employees I had to, to balance the fear of those that they work that they want to feel that the others are vaccinated and the fear of those that they don't want to get the vaccine. And eventually I came to the decision that we will mandate it at five. We are flexible, we are giving exceptions, of course, for health, maybe some religions. Uh But uh we decided to, to mandate it. Now pfizer, we, when we did this decision, we were at 90% vaccination rates when we said we are going to mandate it and that took it up to 96. works. Right. Uh This 10% was never going to move. I felt because no matter what, you have a small number of people that really are scared and they don't feel comfortable to do it. Ok. It worked in our case. We, we took it to 96%. I'm happy for those people. A lot will not disease and some will not die of, of the, of those people. But it's not to me to say because the debate, it's serious debate and there are a lot of pros and cons if you need to push people, if you need to give them the freedom. Uh And uh comes with the territory. If you are elected to run a country, you should be ready to make difficult decisions"
