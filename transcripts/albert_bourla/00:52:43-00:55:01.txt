  "Text": "something I have to kind of people that listen to this, that kind of doubt institutions. do also wanna say that there's quite a few folks who realize they can make money the man is lying to you. government is lying to you. all corrupt. all a scam. farmer is lying to you. They're manipulating you. surprised at how much money can be made with that. And it's sad. So you have to just as people use their common sense to be skeptical when listening to politicians and powerful figures, they should be skeptical to also when listening to sort of the conspiracy theorists or not even the conspiracy theorists, but people who raise questions about institutions, think think on your own, think critically with an open mind everyone could be manipulating you, but also everybody has the capacity to do good. And I think uh science in this pure form, not when entangled with institutions a beautiful thing. And in the hands of many companies, it is a beautiful thing at scale. have a lot of incentive as having created the vaccine at Pfizer, this incredible technology uh sing it praises. the there's a kind of, know, people are skeptical like how much do we trust? excited Albert is about this vaccine. So for example, I mean, not not to do a Shakespearean analysis of your Twitter, but I think you tweeted something about a study with 100% efficacy of the vaccine or in stopping the transmission or something like that. Do you regret sort of being um like over representing the effectiveness of the vaccine? Technically saying correct things, just kind of like the super positive things may be misinterpreted, you know, saying 100%. No,"
