  "Text": "reveal it. I don't think we can look at consciousness that way. I don't think I mean, many people like to try to make that argument that it's a spectrum. Why do we have to say all or nothing? Maybe. And I agree that I actually think it is a spectrum. Um but it's a spectrum of content, not of consciousness itself. So, um you know, if a worm has some level of conscious experience, it is extremely minimal. Something we could never imagine being having the complex experience you and I have maybe some felt sensation of pressure or heat or something super basic, right? So there's there's this range or even if you just think of an infant, you know, like the first the moment an infant becomes conscious, what that there's a very, very minimal experience of inputs of sound and light and, and whatever it is. Um And so there's a spectrum of content, there's a spectrum of how much um a a system is consciously experiencing, but a moment at which you get on the spectrum. And that's, and I truly believe that that piece of it is binary. So if there's no conscious experience, there is no consciousness, you can't say consciousness is there, it just hasn't lit its flame yet. If consciousness is there, there's an experience there, by definition, it has to arise at some point or it has to always"
