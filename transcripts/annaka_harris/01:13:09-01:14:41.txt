  "Text": "of the intuitions I talked about, I mean, I just kind of, I'm taking them for granted that you and everyone knows what I'm talking about. But in terms of science, in terms of the studies, um understanding things like binding processes, understanding just a little bit about how the brain works. And as far as we understand, and then there's just a ton of evidence now to support that our conscious experience is at the tail end of a lot of um brain processing. And so yeah, so just a little bit, I mean, I give in the example in my book, I talk about tennis and the binding of the sights and sounds and felt experience of hitting a tennis ball which in the world are happening at different times the rates. Um It takes the sound waves and the light waves and the felt sensation to travel to my brain are different that there are these binding processes happen to the conscious experience that were essentially delivered to us by, by the brain. Um And so we can get, we can get back in into this. I can answer your your bigger question first. But I, I feel like for, for a lot of people to understand some of the science that already shattering. Some of our intuitions about the role consciousness plays, I think is helpful in terms of being able to be open to thinking about these other"
