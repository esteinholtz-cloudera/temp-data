  "Text": ". So, right. So this is where our intuitions get challenged. I've been thinking about some new examples for this just because I talk about it a lot and, and the truth is most of the things I write about and talk about and think about are so counterintuitive. I mean, that that's really what my game is, is breaking intuitions, shaking up intuitions in order to get a deeper understanding of reality. often, even though I thought about this for 20 years and think about it all the time. It's an obsession of mine really, I have to get back into that mind frame be able to think clearly about it because it is so counter intuit. How long does that take is that depends on if there are kids around or if I'm alone or if I've been meditating. But what I was going to say, actually, I felt like we needed to just take one step back talk a little bit just because I think the importance of shaking up intuitions for scientific advancement is such an important piece of the scientific process. And I think we've reached a point in consciousness studies where very difficult to move forward. And usually that's a sign that we need to start shaking up our intuition. So, you know, throughout history, that the huge breakthroughs, the things that have really shifted our view of the universe and, and our place in the universe. And all of that, those almost always, if not always require that we at the very least our intuitions, update our intuitions. But many of them, we just have to let go of intuitions that are feeding us false information about the way the world works."
