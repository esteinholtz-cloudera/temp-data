  "Text": "interesting I've never been drawn to the why questions I'm interested in the what and the how, is life? What is this place? What are we doing? How are we here, how is this, how is this taking place? You know, but I mean, if, if I had to answer, don't, I guess I don't think there is a why. Really? It's funny, the, the, the quote, thought that comes to mind is really, uh, like a kind of a cheesy quote that I'm sure is printed on a bunch of mugs and T shirts, but it's tick, not Han., I'm gonna get it wrong but it's something like um we're here to awaken from our illusion of separateness. I don't really see that as an answer to the why question. Although that's how it's framed in his quote, we are here for that purpose. I think if there is a purpose worth being here for,, that's kind of the ultimate, I think."
