  "Text": "the point of the zombie experiment. I mean, the zombie thought experiment. I mean, I can't speak for any of the zombies. Is that so for me, I mean, I don't like spending much time on it. I think it has limited use for sure. And I understand your annoyance with it. But for me, what's so useful about it is it gets you to ask the same questions you're asking when you're looking at robots. If you just run the experiment and you say, OK, you know, I'm, I'm sitting here with Lex. What if I try to trick myself? What's different about the world? If I, someone tells me? Actually, he's a robot is essentially what the zombie experiment is. He's over there. He has no conscious experience. He's acting all crazy, but there's no experience there. So it gets you to ask some interesting questions. One is OK when it seems impossible, I just think, no, that's great. That makes no sense. I, I can't, I can't even imagine that.. What do I think consciousness is responsible for? What is consciousness doing in that, in that human over there? That is l that I can't fathom of your behavior and everything that you're you're doing and about without consciousness. So it gets you to ask this question and this, this is, these are the questions I begin my book with um what is consciousness doing? It gets you to ask that question in a, in a deeper way. then I kind of found this alternate. I don't know if other people have done this, but I found this alternate use for it, which is even more useful to me, which is I'm able to do it. Sometimes I'm able to just sit with someone and, and, know, get my imagination going and imagine there really is no conscious experience there in that person. what happened for me the first few times I was able to do this is it reminded me exactly of how I feel when I look at complex plant behavior and other behaviors in nature where I assume there's no conscious experience. And me, it just flips, it just flips everything on its head. It just gets you to be able, it gets you to be open to possibilities that you were close to before. And I think that's useful."
