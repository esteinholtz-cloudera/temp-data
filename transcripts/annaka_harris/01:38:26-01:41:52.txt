  "Text": "? Sure. And that's actually, that's part of what I was when I wanted to kind of talk a little bit about the levels of usefulness of being aware of these different illusions because I would say most of the time in our daily lives, um The typess of illusions that I'm interested in in shaking up are not useful to remind ourselves of most of the time. really think there are different levels of usefulness to about and reminding ourselves of the places where we have false intuitions. And so I, I often use um analogy of living on a sphere. Um So still feels to most of us most of the time, I mean, our intuitive sense, we're not thinking about whether the the earth is flat or a sphere, but we behave as if it's flat and that makes the most sense. And, it would be exhausting to keep reminding ourselves as we walk down the street, like it feels flat but it's not flat. You know, it's like there's just no reason to do it. It's not useful in, in that moment. Um, if you're building a house, you can build it as if the world is flat. Um, but you know, of course, so there, so there are psychological reasons to bring it into view and maybe even spiritual reasons to bring it into view and then there's just like usefulness. So if you're building a rocket to the moon, you better understand the geometry of the earth. Um Even if you're flying an airplane, if you're an airplane pilot, you have, you have to be aware of the truth of our situation. Um And then I think there are other places where it's interesting remind ourselves is where I, I start out my book. Um just a way to inspire awe and to get yourself out of your everyday life and see the big picture, which can be um just a a relief, but also helps you feel more connected to the universe into something larger than ourselves. And so I see these intuitions um reminding ourselves that these intuitions are illusions in the same way that that most of the time not useful they are useful if we want to think about a science of consciousness, um they're useful for a whole range of um neuroscientific studies. And I think they can be incredibly useful um in the same way that lying on the ground and feeling the gravity, pushing you against a sphere and realizing you're floating in the middle of outer space. Um It gives me the same feeling to realize. And so have, I mean, there, there's so many levels to it. But if I'm thinking about difficult things that I've experienced um different traumas in my life, when I take a step back and kind of get this bird's eye view of kind of the mystery of this unfolding of the universe. And the fact that it happened the way it happened and whether it could have happened another way, there's no going back. That is, that's the way it unfolded and being able to surrender to that I think um is very psychologically healthy and, and prevents us from, I mean, I think regret is one of the most toxic loops we can get into. So this is a,"
