So one image I, I came up with recently, I actually wrote about this, I have an article and nautilus about time because I was as I spend time thinking about what it would mean for consciousness to be fundamental. And at the same time, I'm, I'm talking to physicists about different interpretations of quantum mechanics and the, and, and the fact that the ones I'm talking to believe that space and time are, are emergent and are not part of the fundamental story. Um I was thinking about what is it, could time be if it's not the way we experience it? What could it be pointing to? Um And you know, I'm not the first person to think like this, many people have, have um you know, developed different thought experiments around this but um and this is I'm not saying this is the way things are, but this is just one solution is that time and causality appear to us the way they do. Because for whatever reason, we're only perceiving one moment at a time. connections between events that we perceive as time are actually just part of the fabric of real. There's some structure to reality at a deeper level, um where, you know, it's like shining a flashlight on the structure of reality, where for us, for whatever reason, everything else disappears. And the only thing that exists is is that single pin of light that we happen to be inhabiting or that we can perceive, but that the rest of it is there. And so that even though time would be an illusion and, and the causality in the way we experience it, it is an illusion um or it doesn't mean what we think it means. It's still pointing to a deeper structure. There's something that it corresponds to in the fundamental nature of reality. And I've had many enough conversations with da I think know that he, would agree with that, that our perceptions onto something. It's just not experience of it that we're having. So, so to go back to um you uh the idea that all of reality could be um contained in two dimensions and there's something about the, the interaction between different points. Um that cause this so that it seems like there's a three dimensional world when in fact that it's, it's a projection of this two dimensional surface. Um we experience as space still something the fundamental level. It's just that it's not space and that is something that makes a lot of sense to me. I also I posted an excerpt George Musser wrote a great book, Spooky Action at a distance bookie action at a distance. Um And he talks about he's, he's a great science writer and he talks about to kind of absorb what this would mean this A DS CFT duality. And he talks about, he gives an example of um music as an analogy that two different notes can exist in three dimensions as if the other doesn't exist because of the frequency of the, the sound waves. And that in another way you can think of the sound waves existing in different dimensions. don't know if that's,"
