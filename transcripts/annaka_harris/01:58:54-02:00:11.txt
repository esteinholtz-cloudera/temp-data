  "Text": ", what you realize is the source of it is not your conscious experience. And that's the important insight that's the insight. And so there are many insights you can have in meditation that align with the science, which is what's really fascinating because it doesn't have to be that way. Like I can imagine finding meditation to be extremely useful and helping me with anxiety and all the rest and having all kinds of insights that turn out to not be true. But the interesting thing is that these insights actually turn out to be true. Um And so that that is one of them is the, you're just watching what your conscious experience actually is, you realize that it's not doing all of the things you usually feel like it's doing. And so the thoughts really just arise in much the same way that a sound or a sight or feeling. Um you know, maybe your leg starts to hurt you when you're just watching moment by moment by moment, arises, a bird chirping arises, a thought arises, a feeling arises. You're just kind of watching it all unfold and there's something really beautiful about that."
