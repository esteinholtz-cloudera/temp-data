  "Text": ", conscious will. And just in general, that consciousness is not the thing that we feel it is which is driving the behavior is actually at the tail end of it. And so a lot of decision making processes and the there are studies that are more controversial and I, I don't usually like to cite them. Although if you want to talk about them, we can, they're super interesting and intuition shattering. But there, there are now studies specifically about free will to see if there are markers at the level of the brain, they can see what decision you're going to make and when you make that decision. And um I think this the neuroscience inevitably is just going to get better. And so part of the reason I'm so passionate about this, I mean, there's, there's the science and there's just the curiosity that drives me of wanting to understand how the universe works. But I actually see a lot of the neuroscience presenting us with truths that are going to be difficult for us to accept. And I actually think there are really positive ways to view these truths that we're uncovering. And even though they can be initially kind of jarring and even destabilizing and, and creepy, think ultimately, there's actually a lot, can have a positive effect on human psychology and, and a whole range of things um that I and others have, have experienced and that I think it's important for us to talk about because you can't hide from the truth, especially in science, right? Like it just, it, it will reveal itself. And if this is true, I think not only for better understanding the universe than nature, which is kind of my, my primary passion, it's important for us to these facts and realize that they don't, it doesn't necessarily take away the things from us that we fear. Um I, you know, I've heard people say this is talked about common, common point to make or question to ask a scientist. Can you still, you know, enjoy chocolate if you're a molecular biologist? And um is it a molecular biologist that would be the one who would understand how we experience chocolate? We have the wrong science. anyway, if you, if you're focused on the details of the underlying nature of reality, does that take the joy and the pleasure and for lack of a better word, spirituality out of our experience as human beings? And I actually think um for these illusions like free will and self, the reverse is true. I actually think they can give us they are reasons and bases for more connected to each other and to the universe for spiritual experiences for um just on a more basic level for increasing our, our well being just in terms of our psychology of lowering rates of depression and anxiety. And um I actually think these realizations can be extremely helpful to people."
