  "Text": "I think the truth is that when those observations were first made, when the celestial observations were made, that revealed this fact to us, I can't remember how long it took, but I think it was close to 100 years before was actually accepted as common knowledge that we're no longer the center of the universe or of course, we never were. But, and, and that's true. Almost every time we have a breakthrough like that, that challenges our intuitions. There's usually a period of time um we have to and, and this is an important part of the process because often our intuitions give us good information. And so when the science goes against, when our scientific observations go against our intuitions, it's important for us to that in and to see, you know, which side is going to win. And once it's clear that the evidence is winning, um then there's this period of time where we have to grapple with our intuitions and shift the way we frame our worldview and go through that process, free will, free will is a hard one. It's a hard wire. So here we are still in consciousness studies stuck, at least in terms of the neuroscience. And so that's why I started thinking more deeply about that. That's why a lot of scientists right now are actually interested in studying consciousness um where it was very taboo before. And so we're at this really interesting turning point and it's wonderful, but it will require that we shake up our intuitions a bit and reframe some things and look at what the neuroscience is telling us. Um And there are a lot of questions, we have more questions than answers. But I think it's time. I think if we're going to make progress in consciousness studies, we need to start really looking at illusions and false intuitions that are getting in our way. Do you think"
