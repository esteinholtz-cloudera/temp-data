  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Annika Harris, author of Conscious, a brief guide to the fundamental mystery of the mind and is someone who writes and thinks a lot about the nature of consciousness and of reality, especially from the perspectives of physics and neuroscience. now a quick few second mention of each sponsor, check them out in the description is the best way to support this podcast. We got wealthfront for investing, better help for mental health, blink for nonfiction on it for supplements and indeed for hiring, she was wise than my friends.

Maybe you will too. show is brought to you by wealthfront Savings and automated investing accounts to help you build wealth and save for the future. I'm a sucker for good design. And so one of the things that make me love wealthfront is that they have a beautifully designed and streamlined interface for the investing process. As a quick side note, there's a very loud lawnmower outside of where I'm recording and that lawn mower, not only outside, but it's also inside my mind and is playing all kinds of games with my mind. And I wonder if you hear it at all and I wonder if it's even real. I just wanted to acknowledge the obvious in case you do hear it and also acknowledge the obvious psychological complexity of talking into a microphone while you're sitting alone with all the world boiling up all around you in this beautiful chaotic turmoil that defines our reality. that turmoil, you may want to invest in the future. And that's what Wealthfront is good at nearly half a million people using it. should mention in a faint attempt at expertise that federal interest rates have been going up this year. So the 2.55% api savings account is quite an impressive feat, which is exactly what wealthfront offers. You can check them out by going to wealthfront.com/legs. get a $50 bonus with a $500 deposit. episode is also brought to you by better help spelled he LP help. Speaking of the lawn mower, that's outside of my house. Clearly, the problem is not with the lawn mower. The problem is with my mind that problem can be solved through many methods. one of the most powerful is talk therapy. And if you care to try that kind of thing, you should make it super easy. You should make it private obviously and you should be affordable and available to you wherever you are. So should be remote. And that's exactly what better help offers an exploration of the demons that live inside your mind. All of our minds inside the shadow the young shadow of our mind, should explore them with a licensed professional at better help, betterhelp.com/lex. And if you go there to that specific website slash LEX, you will save on your first month. show is also brought to you by Blinks. My favorite app for learning new things. Blinks takes key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books and condenses them down into 15 minutes that you can read or listen to. I am going on a run now because I'm doing a long 12 plus hour run on that run. I will be listening to a nonfiction book. In fact, the book I will be listening to was picked by me by first checking out the of that book on blinks. And again, it's not just a summary, you know, like a cliff note summary. It's a condensation of the key ideas, which is fundamentally different to me than a shallow summary. It somehow feels deep even though it takes a very short amount of time to consume it. Like I said, 15 minutes, it's an excellent way to choose a book that you want to read in full. Get the key insights, read in full and again, return to the insights, time and time again to remind yourself to refresh the lessons that you learned from the book. When you first read it, you can claim a special offer for savings by going to blinks.com/lex. episode is also brought to you by on it, which is a nutrition supplement and fitness company. They make Alpha Brain a new Tropic that helps support memory, mental speed and focus., all of those things are things I care about. As I'm going through a difficult deep work session, deep work is something that one of the people I really admire a friend. Cal Newport talks a lot about and these are sessions when you're really putting your mind to the test in terms of the focus in terms of the depth of the chain of thoughts unbroken that you take yourself on. you know, for me that happens when I'm doing any kind of programming for me that happens when I'm doing design type of thinking. So thinking through the early steps of a programming project of how to solve a particular problem and all of that just is very mentally and intellectually straining. And for that, your mind has to be in a really good place. So as far as supplements go, I think Alpha Brain is a great way to give you a boost in that process. can check them out by going to Lex friedman.com/on. It, show is also brought to you by indeed a hiring website. I've used them for many hiring efforts I've done for the many teams I've led in the past and I'm using them now as I'm hiring a few folks to help with podcasts and video related activities from programming and robotics to a video editor to uh what else? Assistant and camera and translators and dubbers and all that kind of beautiful stuff. I mean, know, forget the specific tasks involved. a really huge believer of being surrounded by people that strive for excellence, work their butt off, but also have a kind of camaraderie on the team where everybody makes each other better, challenges each other to become better and challenges each other to reveal moments of brilliance within themselves. Hiring a team that's excellent is really important. You should use the best tools for the job. Indeed is one such tool. I highly recommend have a special offer only available for a limited time. You can check it out at indeed.com/lex. is the Lux Friedman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends. Here's Anika Harris your book, Conscious. You described evidence that free will is an illusion and that consciousness is used to construct this illusion and convince ourselves that we are in fact deciding our actions. Can you explain this? I think this is chapter"
