  "Text": "to say definitively, I mean, it depends on, you know, you define intelligence and all kinds of things, but obviously humans are unique and capable of all kinds of things that no other mammals are capable of. And there are important differences and I don't think you need any magical intervention of something outside of the physical world to explain it. And the way I think about consciousness, I actually think it's part of the reason we're mistaken about consciousness because we are special in the ways that we're special. And because we're complex creatures, we have these complex brains. So I think we should probably get into some of the details of why I think we're confused about what consciousness is. But just to finish this point, think we don't actually have any evidence that consciousness is complex, that it comes out of complex processing, that it's required for complex processing. And I think we've made this anthropomorphic mistake because we are conscious and it's very hard to, to get evidence. Um It's one of the things that makes consciousness unique and mysterious and why I'm fascinated with it is it's one thing in nature that we can't get conclusive evidence of from the outside. We can buy analogy, you know, you're behaving basically the same way I behave more or less. Um You talk about your conscious experiences and therefore, I just extrapolate from that, that you're having a felt experience in the way I am and, and we can do that throughout nature. Well, there's no physical evidence, there's nothing we can observe from the outside that will give us conclusive proof that consciousness is there. so I think we've made this leap to because we're conscious and because we're unique and special and um complex and intelligent in the way that we are. And because we don't have an intuition that anything else is conscious or we have no feedback about it, made this assumption that consciousness that those things aren't conscious and felt experience does not exist out there in, in other atoms and, and forms of life even, but especially not inanimate objects. Um And therefore, consciousness somehow tied to these other things that make us unique, that consciousness when there is this complex processing, when there is. And we can talk about the evolution argument too, which I think is super interesting to get into. And I'm hoping to talk to Richard Dawkins about this. For my theory about consciousness. He's not interested, not interested. And actually the conversation I would have with him would be very brief because he's just not that interested in this topic. But let's go back to the Richard Dawkins piece because I feel like there's a lot to talk about here in terms of our intuitions about consciousness. What it's doing. Why in my book and everywhere I talk about consciousness, I bring it back to these two questions that I think are at the heart of our intuitions about consciousness. And so your questions about whether human beings are unique and special and all of that, I think are interesting questions and something we could talk about. I see them as separate questions from the consciousness"
