  "Text": "? And completely how we experience. So this is an intuition that for whatever reason has, has always felt true to me. This is, this is the way I thought about things as a child. I've met other people that felt this way when I've had experiences in psychedelics and this is where I start to sound crazy too., but everybody else is crazy except us. But has always seemed right to me. And that's always the thing that I feel like I'm looking for that. It's funny recently, I was thinking that it's, it's as if I feel like I'm and, and it was more how I was thinking of how I felt as a child. But um I, I feel this way a lot as an adult too that the, the image is one of a snow globe that I, that I, that I'm confined to this snow globe based on my human perceptions. And the truth of reality is, is out there it's actually why I'm so drawn to shaking intuitions. I feel like every time we shake up an intuition it's like an opportunity to leave the snow globe for, for a moment. Um, you know, it's like smashing the marbles and seeing, oh, it's not liquid in there. Like I thought it's, it's getting this glimpse of something truer than what we typically experience."
