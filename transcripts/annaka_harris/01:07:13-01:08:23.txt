  "Text": "will say that I believe at this point, I I've been saying 5050 for a long time, I'd say now it's like 5149 in terms of consciousness being emergent versus fundamental. So I, I am not convinced of this at all. I'm not convinced that consciousness is fundamental. What I think is there are very good reasons to think it could be. And essentially all of science up to this point has led by the other assumption by the first assumption that consciousness arises at some point, namely in brains. And that's where all the science has gone. And I think that's wonderful and I think it should keep on going. And I actually think that was a more important place to start. But I think there's a possibility that the correct assumption is that it's fundamental. And so that's the science I support, that's the thing I spend a lot of my time thinking about and talking to scientists and philosophers about. And so I, shouldn't give the idea that I actually have crossed over into believing this is the case. But it is, it's the assumption I follow in my work at this point,"
