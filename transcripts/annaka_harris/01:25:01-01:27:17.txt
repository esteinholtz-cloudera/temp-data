  "Text": "truth is that for the most part, the sense of self is kind of at the core of human suffering because it feels as if we are separate from the rest of nature, we're separate from each other, we're separate from you know, the, the illusion that I that I referenced of feeling like, you know, we have these thoughts that are brain based thoughts, but then the eye swoops in to, to make a decision um in some sense, it goes so deep that it's as if the eye is separate from the physical world and that separation um plays a part in depression plays a part in anxiety, um even plays a part in addiction. So at the level of the brain, I think stop me if I'm repeating myself, but we, we started talking about the default mode network. Um And so we actually know that when the default mode network is quieted down, when people lose a sense of self in meditation and on psychedelic drugs, in, in therapy, there is a feeling that people describe of extremely positive feeling of being connected to the rest of nature. And so that's a piece of it that I think if you haven't had the experience, um you wouldn't necessarily know that would be a part of it. Um But truly having that insight that you're not the self, you feel you are immediately your experiences are embedded the universe and you are a piece of everything and you see that everything is interconnected. And so, rather than feeling like a lonely eye in this bigger universe, there's a sense of a part of something larger than yourself. And this is intrinsically positive for human beings. Um And even just in our everyday lives and choices and what we do for work, feeling part of something larger than yourself is the way people describe spiritual experiences and the way um many positive psychological states are, are framed. And so, there's that piece of it,"
