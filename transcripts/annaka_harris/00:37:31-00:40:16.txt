  "Text": ", absolutely. Well, and this gets to an interesting point actually, which I think a lot about which is memory. Um And we won't go into this yet, but I'll just plant a flag here that memory is um obviously related to time and time is something that I'm fascinated with. And, and for this project, I'm working on now, I've mostly been speaking to physicists who are interested in consciousness. Um And it's partly because of this link between memory and time. And, you know, all of these new fascinating um theories and thoughts around the different interpretations of quantum mechanics. And at, you know, the thing that I've always been looking for is, is really the fundamental nature of reality and why questions about consciousness lead me to wonder if consciousness is a more fundamental aspect of the universe than, than we previously thought. And certainly I previously thought. Um and so memory, but memory is, is tied to so many things. I mean, even basic functions in nature actually. So, so the, the p tendril, as I mentioned, memory comes into play there and that's so fascinating. Um And there is no sense of self without memory, even if you're starting from scratch, as you said, with amnesia, If you truly couldn't lay down any new memories, I think you would, then that sense of self would begin to disintegrate because the sense of self is one of a concrete entity through time. if each moment, if you really were stuck in the present moment, eternally, you'd basically be meditating. in meditation, this is a very common experience is losing that sense of self, that sense of free will that those illusions um more easily drop away in meditation. And I would say for most people who meditate long enough that they do drop away, and there's actually an explanation of the level of the brain as well. default mode network is circuitry in the brain that neuroscientists don't completely understand but no is, is largely, largely responsible for this feeling of being a self. Um And when that circuit gets quieted down, which it does in meditation and also does um with the use of, of psychedelic drugs. And there are other ways to quiet down the default mode network. Um People have this experience of losing this illusion of being a self. They no longer feel that they're a self in the way that they usually do."
