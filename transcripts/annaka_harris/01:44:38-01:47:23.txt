  "Text": "? And I've been following this research from the beginning when they were doing end of life. Yeah, they started with end of life patients. I don't know, maybe 20 years ago I met at a TED conference, I met one of the doctors who was, was doing this research. It was the first time I became aware that the research was happening and I already had my own experiences before that. And so it made perfect sense to me that this would work. It was still astonishing to see the results to see how successful um the work is so much of the time. But it doesn't surprise me. It makes sense and it's actually in line with all these other things. So quieting down the default mode network. of the things that's so transformative about taking something like psilocybin and everyone's experience is different. It can vary each time you take it even in a, in a single person. But the experience I had and the experience that many people have that is so transformative is this feeling that's very hard to describe. But it's a feeling of being one with the universe and that comes with, it's kind of all one feeling that that is again, hard to put into words, but there's this feeling that is OK. And I'd never had that feeling before in my life. And when I took psychedelics, that feeling would stay with me for months and I never understood why. And it was always fascinating to me, but there was, it was as if I was glimpsing a deeper truth of the world that all one thing we're all connected. Um There's no sense that there could even be a feeling of loneliness. It was just this, this visceral sense of being one with everything and that everything was ok that all the things I was afraid of even death um the universe in a sense is just, is, is an endless recycling. And don't know, it's hard to describe, but we also know on the other side that depression and anxiety when people are experiencing those things, the default mode network is more active. And so it's this cycling and this kind of obsessive cycles of thinking about one's self that is a huge part of the suffering in the first place. And so one thing that's surprising to me about the research is that I, I may be fudging the, the data but it's something like 80% of people who are treated for PTSD after one, one session are cured of their PTS."
