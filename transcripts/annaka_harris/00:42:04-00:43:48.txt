  "Text": ", so at the end of my book, I kind of get to the place where I've convinced myself, at least that this question about whether consciousness is fundamental is a legitimate one. And then I just start spending a lot of time thinking about what that would mean if it's even possible to study scientifically. So I mostly talk to physicists actually. Um because I really think ultimately this is a question for, for physics. Um if consciousness is fundamental, I think it needs to be strongly informed by neuroscience. But it's, yeah, if it's part of the fabric of reality, it is a question for a physicist. So I speak to different physicists about different interpretations of quantum mechanics. So getting at the fundamentals. So string theory in many worlds, I spoke to Sean Carroll had a great conversation with Sean Carroll he's so generous because he clearly doesn't agree with me about things. Um But he has a curious mind and he's willing to have these conversations and I was really interested in understanding many worlds better and if consciousness is fundamental, what the implications are. Um So I, that was where I started actually was with many worlds. And then uh we had conversations about string theory and um the holographic principle, I spoke to Lee Smolin and Brian Green and Jan 11 and Carlo Rovelli actually, have you had Carlo on? He's great also and fun to talk to because he's just endlessly curious. Yeah. And you're doing audio, it's all audio. Yeah, but it's in the format of a document. I'm narrating it and kind of telling the story of what questions came up for me, what I was interested in exploring and then why I talk to each person I talked to, by"
