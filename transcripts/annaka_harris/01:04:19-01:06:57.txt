  "Text": "think it'll be a little bit of both. I mean, I think the science has a very long way to go and the truth is, I don't even think we can get to the science yet because we have to do this work and this is why I'm so passionate about this work. Um And it's really, it's really taking hold. I mean, there are scientists, neuroscientists and physicists interested in consciousness and of having gotten over the initial of wrestling with these intuitions so that it's now being talked about in a serious way, which was the first huge hurdle. But I think a lot more of that has to happen. A lot more of the intuition breaking from the science. We already have. I mean, I think we almost need to catch our intuitions up to what we, we already know. And then continue to break through these intuitions systematically so that we can really think more clearly about consciousness. Um There are a couple of um scientists now working on theories of consciousness which do go, they don't quite go to the fundamental level, but they go extremely deep. Um So that something like an electron might be conscious under their theory. This is um information theory. IIT with Christoph Koch and Giulio Tononi. Um I've spoken to, to both of them, I spoke to um Christof Koch uh once or twice for, for this project, I'm working on now. Um What they're working on is incredibly interesting to me and I think very important work. Um However, think they are also really led by some false intuitions about self and free will and I think that will be a limit to their work so we can get into that. But we will, we will, which is that they're working on I think is the most important next step forward, which is just even being open to the fact that consciousness goes as deep as particles and being rigorous. But even their theory isn't going as deep as I think we need to go. Um And it's hard to say how we could actually study this scientifically, but that's part of the reason why I'm such a supporter of IIT and why I'm so interested in what they're doing, even though I think they're wrong is because they're opening this path and I think they're getting more people interested. And I think, um yeah, it's hard for me to imagine what the science will actually look like. OK. So"
