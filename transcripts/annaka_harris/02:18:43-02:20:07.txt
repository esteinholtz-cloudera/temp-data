  "Text": "seems like that to. No, no. So I I said as an experience of being a self is due to memory. It seems that consciousness and time are inextricably linked. But I, I think that may be an illusion also. And when I think about consciousness being fundamental and you know, someone oops someone like Max Tegmark, I don't know if there are other mathematicians, I'm sure there are. He's the only one I know of who will talk about forms and shapes as not just being, he talks about them as being actual in nature that, that exist, that are not just mathematical structures that we can think about. Um But any mathematical structure that comes out of the math actually exists in reality. And so when I think about consciousness being fundamental, think about and mathematics being a description of the structure of it. that when mathematicians say things like that or physicists say things like that, it makes sense we're talking about conscious experience of some sort."
