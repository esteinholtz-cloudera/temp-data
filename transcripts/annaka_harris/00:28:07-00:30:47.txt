  "Text": "well. And I should also, I mean, this brings up another point which is that there is a difference between voluntary and involuntary behavior. So of course, we have reflexes and it is a different, there's different brain processing in action when I make a decision about water or tea, there is, you know, I if my behavior is forced from the outside or if I have a brain tumor that's causing me to make certain decisions or feel certain feelings. And so the point is that at bottom, it's all brain processing and behavior. But the reason why certain actions feel willed, there's a good reason why it feels that way it's to distinguish our own self generated behavior based on thinking and you know, possibly weighing the different results of different things. I already had caffeine today. I don't want more, you know, there, there are all these um processes, things that we can point to and things that we can't, things I'm affected by at a subconscious level. Um that is very different from an unwilling action or a reflex or something like that. And so some, some people I can imagine, I haven't used the P tendril example, but I can imagine they wouldn't like that because the P tendril um sounds more to them like a reflex and that doesn't address the question of a much more complex um decision making process. But I think at bottom that is, that is what it is. And that's really where the illusion of free will and the illusion of self, which I think is there kind of two sides of the same coin come from. So even when we intellectually understand that everything we're feeling, everything we're doing is is based on our brain processing and brain behavior. If you're a physical, you, you've bought into that. Um Even when you intellectually understand that we and I include myself in this, we still have this feeling there's something that stands outside of the brain processing that can intervene. And that's the illusion was tweeting with someone recently, which I almost never do. But we're working in the TED documentary that I'm making right now. We're working on the episode on Free Will. So I was allowing myself to go back and forth in a way that I don't usually on Twitter about Free Will. It was, it was a friendly debate. Going to go into the reasons why I'm not crazy about Twitter. But let's leave that for another time. mean, talk about how hard it is to have this conversation when we have as many hours as we like, you know, trying to do it in sound bites over Twitter. I"
