  "Text": ", I'm not really doing anything. I mean, the, the exercise is really so simple, it's just paying attention to your present moment experience and it's an extremely challenging thing to do. It's not the natural state of the brain. It's an exercising concentration um which is why, you know, athletes and, and other people who, who spend a lot of time needing to focus intensely, find it so useful. I mean, it's really um a focus, a concentration practice. Um but all it is really, I mean, there are different ways there are different methods but really is quite simple um at its core, which is just paying close attention to your present moment experience. And so um in the pasta, which is what I've mostly been trained in, um you're usually paying attention to the breath, but there's always some focus of concentration and the focus can even be just an open awareness just your mind go just what, what comes into your experience and part of that is the mind, part of it is the external world. Um So you hear a sound. Do you think a thought? You feel a feeling your cheek is itching? Am I gonna scratch it? Am I not gonna scratch it just like, sounds like the most boring thing in the world. And what's interesting is mo paying close attention to the most boring thing in the world is incredibly fascinating. that each breath, no, two breaths are the same that time keeps moving that your thoughts keep appearing. Um Yeah, I mean, it's a spiritual practice"
