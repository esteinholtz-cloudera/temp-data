  "Text": ". So I, and you are very useful shorthand, even though at some level they are illusions, very useful shorthand for the system of my brain really. And you know, and my body, the whole system that I is useful for that. But the illusion is when we feel like there's something outside of that system that can intervene, that is free, that's somehow free from the physical world. Um I can have the thought. Yeah, I really not crazy about having intellectual back and forth on Twitter and then feel like I decide to not follow that thought. Right? And the feeling that's that, that's the feeling um where the illusion comes in because it really feels as if sure my brain had that original thought and then I came in and made a different decision. of course, the truth is it was just further brain processing that got me to decide not to go down that path.
