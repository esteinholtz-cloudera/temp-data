I'm sure he did many other plant studies, but this is the one I was reading about. And I'm hoping this analogy, I'll just set it up. I'm hoping that this analogy will be something that we can keep coming back to as we move forward because, know, as we shake up our intuitions and get confused and then we come back to our intuitions and say no, that just can't be, I think this analogy might be helpful. But what kind of plant was he working on? A pea tendrils? So a pea plant has these tendrils, you can, you can picture them, they, they coil. So don't, I don't know what year this research was done. I'm guessing in the eighties, but"
