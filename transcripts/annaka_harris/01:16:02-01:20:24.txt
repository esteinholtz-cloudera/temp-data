  "Text": "I out of sync right now? Brain is constantly making adjustments and so it can shift for you while you're doing that, which is probably part of the thing that's driving you crazy. OK. So I'll start with binding processes and then I'll just give a couple of examples. Um So yes, there's this window um where your brain is putting all the information together to deliver you a present moment experience that is most useful for you to navigate the world. Um as I said, and you know, I use this example of tennis in my book. So the sights and sounds are coming at us at different rates. Um It takes longer for a sensation in my hand when I hit the ball with the racket to travel to my brain than it does for the light waves to hit my retina and get processed by the brain. So all these these signals are coming in at different times. brains go through this process of binding to basically weave it all together. So that our our conscious experience of that is of seeing, hearing and feeling the ball hit the racket all at the same time. And that's obviously most useful to us. is is mostly about timing. It can be about other things. But I was just talking to David Eagleman who was talking about a very simple experiment. Actually. And this kind of shows how your brain is basically always interacting with the outside world and always making adjustments to make its best guess about the most useful present moment experience to deliver. this is a very simple experiment. This is from many, many years ago. Um And David Eagleman was involved in this research where they had participants hit a button and that button caused a flash of light. And our brains through binding the brain, it notices is is able to kind of calibrate the experience you have because the brain is aware that it is its own hand that is causing the light to flash that there's this cause and effect going on. And so you this experience of pushing the button that causes the flash of light, which is true and the the light flashes, can start to introduce longer pauses. Um starting with 20 milliseconds, 30 milliseconds going up to I think 100 maybe even 200 milliseconds where if you do it gradually, since your brain is making the adjustment, um you can introduce a delay. I think it's up to 200 milliseconds. If you do it gradually, you will still have the experience, even though there's now a delay between when you hit the button and the light flashes, will still have the exact same experience you had initially, which is that the light flashes right? When you push the button in your experience nothing is changing. then, so they, they gradually give a delay, acclimated to that because it was done gradually. If they then go back to the original instantaneous flash, your brain doesn't have time to make the adjustment. And you have the experience that the light flashed before you hit the button. And that is your true experience. It's not like you're confused, but that is your brain didn't have time to, to make that adjustment. You think you're in the same environment you're pushing the button, it makes the light flash, it's kind of all the time. But then the the participants are suddenly saying, oh wait, that was so weird. The light flashed before I hit the button. so these, they built a Ro Sham Beau rock paper scissors computer game that was unbeatable based on this glitch that you can present in binding by training someone. If you introduce a delay slowly enough, then the computer can get the information before it responds. But you still have the experience that you're both out your rock or paper scissors at the same time. But in actuality, the computer your choice before it makes its choice. And it's in this window of milliseconds where you don't notice it."
