  "Text": "don't know how quickly it goes down if you just take one out and it depends on which one. I think. I half agree and half disagree with what you're saying. But yeah, I mean, the other thing you notice when you spend a lot of time in meditation and when you spend a lot of time, kind of shaking up these intuitions that I think get in the way of clearly about what consciousness is um that we are these systems in nature that are not at all isolated. And there are the obvious ways like if I just stopped drinking water, you know, going to change the system very drastically, right? So there's just, you know, the the energy consumption, but the fact that we exchange ideas is um we, we part of who I am is everyone I've interacted with. And of course, the people I interact more with have, have sculpted me more, but we, our brains are sculpted through our interactions with each other as well."
