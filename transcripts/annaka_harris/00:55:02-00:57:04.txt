  "Text": "you really think that's a question? one step back, we look out at the universe at, at this point in, in our scientific understanding, we know that essentially we're all made of the same ingredients, right? They're, they're atoms in the universe doing their thing, they find themselves in different configurations based on the laws of physics. Um And then the question is if we look out at all of the configurations of atoms in the universe and ask of these entail conscious experiences, which of these have a felt experience of being the matter they are. they're really only too broadly speaking, they're really only too assumptions to make here. And the first one is the one that science has, has taken and that I have for most of my career as well, and that in many ways makes the most sense which is electrons aren't conscious, tables aren't, there's no felt experience there. But at a certain point in complex processing, um that processing entails an experience of being that processing. Now that that's just a fascinating fact all on its own. And I love to spend time thinking about that. But the question is, does consciousness arise at some point? Are some of these collections of atoms conscious um or are all of them? Because we know the answer isn't none. You know, I know that I'm at least having a conscious experience. I know that conscious experiences exist in the universe. Um so the answer isn't none. So the answer has to be all or some. And this is a starting assumption that you're really kind of forced to make and that it's all or some or some I would say one is some. Also, we either need an explanation for why there's nonconscious matter in the universe. And then something happens for consciousness to come into being or it's part of the fundamental nature of reality."
