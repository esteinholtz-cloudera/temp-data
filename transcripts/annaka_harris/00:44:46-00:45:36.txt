  "Text": "there, there isn't really, the problem is they're all crazy. They're crazy. Each one is than the and my own. I mean, my own thoughts now I have to be very careful about the words I choose because mean, it's, it's just like talking about um the different interpretations of quantum mechanics. It's o once you get deep enough, um it's so counterintuitive and it's so beyond anything we understand that they all sound crazy. Many worlds sounds crazy. String theory. I mean, these are things we just cannot get our minds around really. And so that's kind of, that's the realm I love to live in and love to explore in the realm that to my surprise, my interest in consciousness has taken me back to. Can I ask you a question"
