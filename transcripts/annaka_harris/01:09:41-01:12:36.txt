  "Text": "there are a lot of places we could go with. This one is there is actually work being done by people like David Eagleman. He's a neuroscientist. I don't know if you know him, you should talk to him for your podcast. If you haven't, he's wonderful, great science communicator. He's someone I interviewed for my current project to. So he's done this actually. OK, there are many places we can go. One is does work with sensory edition Sensory Substitution and this is going in some very interesting directions and, and maybe partly answers your question which is giving humans qualia sensory experiences that we're not wired for, that human beings have never had before. let me know what you're most interested in hearing about, but we could talk about things like the brain port. Um There was actually a study done. I just talked to one of the participants in the study where they were seeing if they could give human beings an experience of Magnetic North. So other animals have this um this sense that, that we don't have where they can feel intuitively the way that our eyes work to give us an intuitive sense of our environment. We don't have to translate the information coming in through our eyes. We just have a map of the external world and we can navigate it. Um So many animals use a sense of magnetic north to, to get around and it's an intuitive sense. I spoke to someone who was in this part of this experiment. Um And it was fascinating to hear him acquire a sense, not only that he had never had, but that no human being had ever had. So when I asked him to describe the experience, um it was challenging for him and understandably so because it would be like you describing sight to someone who's never seen. But this is clearly possible and scientists like David Eagleman and others are working on these. And so I do think it's possible that this, that this scientific advancements may actually start to dovetail with the consciousness research in terms of being able to things we've never experienced before. But I do think that at some level, yes, we're limited as human beings. Um We may be able to find some proof or enough proof to at least that consciousness is fundamental or, you know, who knows one day actually believe that that's the correct scientific view of things and not really be able to get our minds around that or to understand what it means and certainly not to know what it feels like. I mean, we can't, we don't even know what it feels like to be other creatures, maybe what it's like to be you."
