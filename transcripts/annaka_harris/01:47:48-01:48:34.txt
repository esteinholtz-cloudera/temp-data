  "Text": "think it's actually important for this work. one of the questions I ask everyone I talked to for this series. Many of them, I won't be able to use that audio for a lot of them. Yes. And what their experience was. And if that's informed, actually initially in the fifties, I want to do more research on this and look into it. But in the fifties, there were some studies that were being done with scientists who there were hundreds of scientists they put into the study where they were on the brink of some kind of discovery where they were stuck. So they had been doing research and they were stuck and they used psychedelics to come up with an answer to find a path forward and it was extremely useful for that."
