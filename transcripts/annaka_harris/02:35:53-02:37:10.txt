  "Text": "of ideas.

And so it is all one thing and then there are these shapes that take form and the there's a felt experience, right? It's all felt experience. And so we're able to let go of this sense of self or this illusion of self, um the idea that experiences are happening to something or to someone drops out and what you get is just experiences arising. So there's the fundamental nature of the universe which obviously has a structure and obeys laws. But what you get out of that are appearances of different conscious experiences. They're, they're just into being right? And so there is under that view, I mean, there are different ways to look at the fundamental nature of reality without consciousness and kind of come up with a similar view. But that view, it is just kind of one, it's one thing with different experiences popping up. And"
