  "Text": "speaking of memes, what the heck do you think is up with Elon Musk talking about Dogecoin. A lot, sort of from the Cryptocurrency community. I've been talking to a lot of, sort of technologists, I guess, and reading papers on Cryptocurrency, it's like nobody really sees Dogecoin as a revolutionary crypto technology. A lot of people talk about its security issues. There's a bunch of issues it has., you did say that money is a kind of a social construct, right?

I can't even because it could happen, it could happen. But if there's any serious way to answer that question, well,"
