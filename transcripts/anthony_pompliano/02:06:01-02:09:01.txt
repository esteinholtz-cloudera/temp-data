  "Text": "Amazon is the one that I know the numbers on in terms of the early volatility uh every year since it gone, it has gone public, it's had a double digit drawdown in that year. Uh The average is over 30% and one time it drew down over 95%. a lot like Bitcoin, right? Like, oh wow, this is crazy. it's one of the best performing stocks in the last 20 years, if not the best performing stock. And so volatility is not positive or negative, it's positive or negative compared to the position you're in. So if you're long and it's volatile to the upside, it's positive. If you're long holding something and it's volatile to the downside, you see it as a negative, it's all about perspective that said, um another way that I look at this is every asset priced in Bitcoin is down significantly. So over the last 135 years, the dollar priced in Bitcoin has crashed 99%. you denominate stocks, it's down like 80% 85%. If you denominate gold, if you denominate bonds, if you just go down online real estate, et cetera, it's all down massively against Bitcoin. Now, you could argue that that's because Bitcoin is appreciating in us dollar terms you could actually argue that the world is repricing this asset. It's doing price discovery on this asset. And it's essentially comparing, it's saying, hey, Bitcoin versus this stock or Bitcoin versus this ounce of gold or Bitcoin versus you know, this dollar, which is more valuable and it continues to move up in the rankings in terms of the value that the world ascribes to this. Some of that's based on Lindy effect, just the longer it persists, the more likely it is to survive. Some of that's based on like the underlying fundamentals of how much computing power, the usage transaction volume, things like that. some of it also is that as more and more people wake up to the fact that it's a finite supply asset that has a place in the world and demand increases, people just naturally compete and ascribe more value to it. And so the volatility, I think all comes back to like, what do you price your life in for a majority of people that's dollars. And so you look at the US dollar price, you get all this volatility. beauty of this is that 60% that doesn't move regardless of price upward or downward in movement. people aren't looking at the day to day price. they've basically said is I've acquired X amount of Bitcoin and I'm just gonna hold it for years and every time somebody's done that right? If, if uh you bought Bitcoin at any point in the last 12 years and you held it till today, are up in US dollar terms. Now, if we had this conversation 18 months ago, couldn't say that. it's all about not only the acquisition price, if you will, it's also when are you looking at it? Right? Because there was a point in 2017, you could have said the same thing, but in 18, you couldn't. And so I tend to think a lot about um humans are really, really bad at short term uh decision making because we're so emotional, especially when something has a price"
