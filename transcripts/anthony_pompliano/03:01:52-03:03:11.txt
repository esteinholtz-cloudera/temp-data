  "Text": "people talk about this question, I think that they really focus on money as a means to getting materialistic things. So they want a big house, they want a boat, they want a fast car, they want, you know, whatever they think that's the stuff that will make them happy. I think about it is if you have resources, you can have time and if you have time and you spend it the way that you want to spend it, then that's ultimately happiness. So I always say to people, if you think that money doesn't buy you happiness, what if I told you that if you had more money, you could spend more time with your family. reframes it and now is all about, I want to do certain things in life, but there's a lot of people who spend their life, not doing those things because they feel the need to pursue economic means as a way to uh provide a living or whatever. And so I explained that I said, listen in my opinion again, it's my opinion. It's what makes me happy if I can leverage financial resources to create more time to do the things I like, I'm happier not work for everybody, but like that's what works for me. And so there's this element of like, I don't care what other people think if they like that or not because they're not me, right? Like, like there's almost this element of like you gotta figure out what works for you and if it works for me then like,"
