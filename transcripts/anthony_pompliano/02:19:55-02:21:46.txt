  "Text": ". Uh I can't remember if he said it first or if the other person did and then he um you know, repeated it, but he definitely, he was trying to get that read into the record for sure. And so, uh you know, you can imagine one again, the meme speaking insult to the Bitcoin community was, you know, made him very, very well liked. But also two was um it does go back to this idea almost of uh if you and I sat down with 10 CEO S and we interviewed each one of them and then we went in a room and we deliberated and we said we have to pick the person who's going to be the most successful one of the inputs, not all the inputs, but one of the inputs would be who's the person who we believe has the best ability to raise capital, recruit people and tell a story to the world that will get them to follow. so somewhere like Elon would probably be the best example of this. you have decentralized products, have no kind of leader, right? In the sense of uh somebody who is financially uh ascribed to be that leader and, and kind of the the executive decision maker. what you have to do is you have to look at these technologies in these communities and say, well, which volunteer teams or which technologies have been able to coalesce these groups around it and in some way, build the same level of engagement and protection and things like that. And so you naturally get tribalism but you also get things like shit coin because what it does is it's not only a um kind of verbal attack towards uh others, a rallying cry for internal. What's so funny is that it was started with the Bitcoin community talking about everybody, but now you've seen adoption in other communities who use it, you know, basically say, well, we're not a Bitcoin. It's the, it's the next guy."
