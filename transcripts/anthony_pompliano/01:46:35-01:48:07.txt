  "Text": "there's a couple of different things that you can do, right? And let's use the legacy system as kind of an example. So if I want to um, get currency and I put in my bank account, it sits there. I have to trust that the bank doesn't go under. Nobody steals it all this kind of stuff. There's insurance for it, right. There's all these kind of benefits in the legacy system, uh, to make sure that as long as I don't have, you know, millions and millions of dollars there, I'm gonna be protected pretty much if anything happens through FDIC insurance. I want to do that, I'm taking that counter party risk though. So it's mitigated, but there's still counter party risk. I'm, I'm counting on that back, but it is easier to move it around. Right? If all of a sudden you call me up and say, hey, send me some money. I can press a couple of buttons on my computer and it'll send it to you. I want deeper level of security, I can go and I can get the physical dollars and I can go and I can, you know, put it under my mattress right. And I can say, you know what, it's not gonna be as easy to send it to you immediately. But if I really want to, I can go underneath my mattress pretty quickly. I can grab it. I can get it back to the bank and then I can send you the money. third thing I could do is I could basically take those physical dollars out of the bank and I could go and I could go put it literally, uh you know, in a vault somewhere that I don't have control over, that's behind 10 passwords, uh and biometric scanning and like it's really difficult to even get to it. Right. So if you can almost look at, it's like there's three stages of security that you could have in the nutritional world. The same thing is true in Bitcoin. So you could buy Bitcoin on any exchange. You could do it on Black Fi, but you also can do it on places like Coinbase, Gemini Kraken, et cetera"
