  "Text": ", so I always go first to, we don't need to have competition like in terms of like a direct competition between the dollar and Bitcoin, right? Um If you look at most technologies in the world, uh the really valuable ones are actually market, expanding technologies than simply just market share, stealing technologies, right? So if you look at Uber, for example, Uber didn't just say, hey, I'm gonna go take out all the taxis, right? It actually drastically expanded the market for people. Now there's literally millions of people in the United States who don't have cars because they use Uber, right? And so I think that Bitcoin is very similar in that. Um yes, there is a component of medium of exchange uh in terms of the dollar, but also there is this component of just store value assets in general. so when you start to look at Bitcoin specifically, I think that what you're seeing is you're seeing a generational gap where young people say I grew up with a phone in my hand, I'm digitally native, the whole idea of going to the bank and sending a wire or going to an ATM and getting physical cash is an antiquated idea in their mind. Right? I, I, one time I asked my brother, he's 24 years old and I said, hey, how do you send money to your friends? And then he gave me one answer, which I expected, which was Venmo. And the second answer I didn't expect. He said, Uber, said, how do you send money via Uber? He said, well, we get in a car together and at the end we split the ride. And so again, you and I have probably both done that, but I never thought of it as a way to send money to each other. And so it, it is a psychological difference between even me who's only, you know, a decade older than him or so, uh and his peer group. so I think as we're watching, kind of Bitcoin continue this ascent. Ultimately, what we're seeing is an entire generation of kids are saying, listen, if I look at financial assets across the board, I have stocks, I have bonds, I have currencies and I have commodities. I know that bonds from a real rate return perspective is flat to negative, right? I'm going to make no money on this because I have a belief that my dollar is being devalued. actually what we're starting to see is again, the internet has broken down these walled gardens and kind of these centralized uh hubs of information in that if you were to look at, let's say the stock market from 1971 to today in dollar terms, it's a 45 degree angle right up into the right. Right. You know, it's kind of 78 10% growth uh every year. And it's amazing, just get invested in the stock market and you'll make money over a long period of time regardless of the dips along the way. you denominate that same stock market in gold, the stock market is down since 1971. so, is it so much that the stock market is accruing true value or is it that the underlying currency in which it is denominated in is being devalued? Right? And I was being devalued in a very disciplined way, right? In terms of it's not like it went 50% devaluation uh in a short period of time, but it's still being devalued. And so I think that people are waking up to this idea that a traditional 6040 type global portfolio doesn't work anymore, right? 40% of it uh in bonds uh is just not going to get it done. so when you start to look at this, people first look at Bitcoin via two main ways. In my opinion, they look at it one as a store value. Should I actually go and put some of my wealth there? Use it as a savings technology, right? We ask people uh in the traditional world if you're a teacher, a fireman, uh an accounting, you know, mid-level manager. Uh we say, hey, go do your job be the best in class as a fireman or as a teacher. then, oh, by the way, you have to be a professional investor as well, because if you just put your dollars in your bank account, you're literally going to have your wealth devalued away over time. So you can't just save, you have to invest. is a really tall task for people. They have a hard enough time just doing their job, right? Taking care of their family right now, they gotta go be an investor. So I think savings technology for a Bitcoin standpoint is if you buy Satoshi or, or or Bitcoin over time, it will uh increase from a purchasing power standpoint because there's a fixed supply and demand continues to rise. then you start to look at well, what other assets do people put in their portfolios, whether it's art, it's real estate, it's precious metals or something else. Most of those assets are not because people actually think that they're going to go up in value over time. They a store of value, right? The reason why somebody buys gold is because it's a store of value, right? Historically, that's a narrative driven uh type asset though, right? We tell people it's scarce. We tell people that it is a store of value. you look at it though, we don't know how much gold exists in the world. We have a good estimate, right? But we don't actually, we can't prove how much there is. don't know how much is coming out of the ground every day again. Great, fantastic estimate. But we can't prove it. And we don't know what the total"
