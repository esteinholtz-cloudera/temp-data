  "Text": "the technical security of a Blockchain. So when you look at, let's say um Bitcoin versus Ethereum, right? has decided and that community has decided security is the number one thing that you have to optimize for so decentralization um over everything else in terms of transaction speeds, uh cost, anything that you could come up with that is uh something that would be important for a currency. The number one thing to optimize for is security. And as we have seen uh with a lot of technologies, right? Facebook's Libra are now what's known as DM is a great example. Uh not having decentralization susceptible to the nation state. And so a lot of these other platforms and blockchains, uh they say security is important but it's not the most important thing. We believe there's a trade off between, you know, a little less security and transaction speed or compos ability or, or whatever it is. And so take Ethereum as kind of the second uh largest uh community and Blockchain by market cap. was created because somebody wanted to, or a group of people wanted to do something on Bitcoin, they felt like they couldn't do it. And so they said, hey, we're gonna go create something that has these smart contracts that we can then go do here again. This is technology, right? So the tribalism of like you're right, you're wrong to me is a little childish just in the sense of like the market is going to decide what is most valuable. then when you go inside of that community, like there's a lot of dumb ideas people are trying to build around Bitcoin. There's also a lot of really, really great ideas that people are trying to build around Bitcoin, same thing in the Ethereum world. And so what you end up getting I think is the tribalism really comes out of the idea that there's a ticker price that is attached to all of this, right? If you go back in history of technology, capitalists didn't sit around the table and yell and scream at each other in this like religious zealot way, right? Because you bet on one type of cloud computing platform and I bet on another one, right. It's just the market's gonna desire. We're both gonna work on you and try to make ours successful. Uh Here, I think that the sensitivity and mainly comes out of the Bitcoin community is that a lot of this is being funded not only by venture capitalists and kind of professional money managers and asset allocators. also this element of including the retail investor and the public. And so whether it's through IC OS or some other forms of capital raising, um There's arguments for it saying, hey, look, uh this now gives kind of the little guy some sort of access and, and ability to do it, but there's also arguments against it. Some people say, hey, it's easier to dupe them and it's easier to run scams and kind of all this stuff. And so ultimately, I think that uh crypto is this like arena of ideas. It is literally the war of attrition. uh what will end up happening is 10 years from now. You and I will talk and we're going to say, well, the market said X was valuable and Y wasn't. And so all of the tribalism from between, you know, here and there, uh it's fun, it's, you know, engaging, whatever, but ultimately, it doesn't really matter."
