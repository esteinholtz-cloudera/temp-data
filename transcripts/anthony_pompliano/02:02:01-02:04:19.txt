  "Text": "think that there's just kind of timeless advice when it comes to, uh investing or, or acquiring an asset in general. Uh dollar cost averaging is usually the best way to think about it. And what I mean by that is um most people don't just have a pile of uh currency sitting there, right? It's not like they have a million dollars sitting in their bank and like, what do I do with it? Uh That situation aside, uh what happens is they trade their hours and their effort for currency. And so as they get paid every two weeks, let's say, the best way to acquire Bitcoin without having to worry about timing markets and being a professional trader is to simply take whatever the percentage is that you want and to buy Bitcoin when you get your paycheck. So if you get paid on the first and 15th of every month, on that day, you should go take, you know, let's say it's 3% of your paycheck, 3% go by Bitcoin. Don't worry about what the price is. Just do that over time. And the reason why that's important is, um, if in December of 2017, when Bitcoin is at $20,000 it was the height of kind of this last, uh, big upwards movement. You had taken all of your money and you had put it into Bitcoin. You would have had to wait almost three years just to get back to quote unquote break even in us dollar terms. at the same time, you had simply bought then and over the next three years, bought every two weeks, you would have been up hundreds of percent three years later because what ended up happening was you bought a bunch of Bitcoin when it was at 1512, 10, 9834555, you know, all the way back up on the other side. so dollar cost averaging is one of these weird things that uh it almost sounds too easy. what we find is in America, we have a lack of financial education. so rather than try to be smart of the markets, what most people are better off doing is just say, hey, set your, what's called an asset allocation plan. I want 30% in stocks. I want 10% in real estate. I want this, this whatever and every time you get your paycheck, just think of it as a savings account. Right. Just put it in based on those percentages and don't think about it over a long enough period of time, what we find is almost anyone in the United States. Right. There's exceptions, but almost anyone in the United States can become a millionaire in their lifetime if they follow these plans and have that long term view and they allow compounding to work for them."
