  "Text": ", I think there's a couple of key pieces, right? So one like one of the actual most impactful data points if you were or kind of stories for me was the Pat Tillman story. So I played football in high school and I was gonna go play in college. Um and seeing, you know, this NFL player who basically just one day said,, I'm gonna go and do this instead uh and walk away. I don't know necessarily if it was a uh I wanna pursue the same story, right? And obviously he ended up dying. And so not exactly the, uh, the end result that you want, but I think it was almost like, uh, he made it ok if you were on a certain trajectory in life to go take this detour and, and to go do it., but the second thing is I was 17. You're pretty stupid when you're 17, you're pretty naive when you're 17. Right? And so, uh, I almost, um, kind of backed into the deployment because I signed up, uh as a, uh, a reserve member. And so basically the plan was to sign up for the Reserves. I was gonna go to basic training, get all the, you know, kind of education and. I was gonna go to college and then after college, you know, maybe there's a chance that you will go and serve or do whatever for me, I ended up getting deployed when I was a junior in college that we got pulled out of school. And so at 20 years old, uh, it's not exactly what you thought you were signing up for. Right. Especially to kind of leave school to go do it. then on top of that, uh I probably had an advantage over most people both on the uh entry to combat and the exit to uh kind of a combat situation which it was football. So I always explain that um, in hindsight, you're in a male dominated testosterone driven kind of combative sport where it's us first them and, and, uh, there's training and, and, uh, you know, injuries and just kind of all of the things that go into playing a combat sport like football now they give you guns, but you still have a uniform on still male dominated. It's just a little bit, you know, more serious in terms of the injuries and, and, uh potential death and things like that. But also on the exit from that deployment, most guys I was there with, they're going back to being, you know, prison guards, police officers working at the lumber yard, you know, just kind of everyday Americans. so I had the fortunate ability to go back into uh kind of that combative environment, go back to play football. And so it was almost this like deescalating on the way out uh where they take your guns away, we still got a uniform, still male dominated, uh still combative and then eventually you're just a normal citizen. And so I think that in some weird way, I was, you know, very fortunate to kind of on the entry and exit have that experience where other guys"
