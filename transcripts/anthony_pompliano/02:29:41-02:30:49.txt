  "Text": "of Tesla. And uh the CFO S new uh title is a Master of Coin. And so uh when you have a sense of humor and frankly, uh a level of uh self-confidence uh an element of uh an appreciation for irony in the world is actually one of the least crazy things that you could talk about when you're willing to go to techno king of Tesla master of Coin uh and all this stuff. And so think that Elon uh doesn't get enough credit frankly for his understanding of internet culture, understanding of memes and understanding of frankly human psychology and marketing. so in some crazy way, every time he talks about Dogecoin, it's a rallying cry for an entire generation of kids. It's a rallying cry for an entire industry uh in terms of cryptocurrencies and digital technologies. this is the flag and this is the thing that he can yell and scream about and tweet about without worry of punishment."
