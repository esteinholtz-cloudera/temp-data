  "Text": "ultimately digital technologies are merely conduit to usher us into that world. And I think the most fascinating part of this entire industry is people who are trying to figure out now that we're going to have these digital technologies, how do we usher in that automated world faster? so there's people who are building all kinds of incredible things, right? There's literally um some technologies where you can stream uh for paying for consumption of content, right? There's I saw somebody recently who they basically said, hey, I have created something but it's not going to be released until everyone in almost like a GoFundMe type situation pays for it in combination and then it gets unlocked. so when you start to think about this, it's not only innovation on the technology front, it's innovation around the way that we form uh capital, it's the way that we organize resources, it's the way that we build companies, it's the business models, right? It's the application of those technologies. All that stuff starts to change and go back to 22,007. It's when the iphone came out. Uber wasn't possible, right? I mean, you just go online like all these companies that weren't possible before the digital technologies are kind of adopted on a global scale. I think that we all myself included drastically underestimate how fast and how big innovation can be. Uh because it's just hard, right? Like, like we like to think line and that's not how the world works."
