  "Text": "you also think about it in the sense of when you're somebody on a mission to create interplanetary life when you're trying to solve or put a dent in the climate crisis or create electric vehicles and be the first American company. And you know, however long sec or other things in your life that just don't, you don't ascribe that much importance to, compared to those things. almost uh nuisances. And that's scary. I think for shareholders of a company, when the person that you're trusting to lead you to the promised land and create shareholder value doesn't put value on certain things. But at the same time, always look at it as a tug of war, how much of the actions of what he's doing and calling attention to actually changed the way that regulators, lawmakers, politicians, countries, whatever act he may not be able to say do acts on the techno king and they go do it. with every step he makes, he changes some of their behavior. And so I think that it's um a really kind of game of like 3d chess that frankly I'm not privy to. Right. And I'm kind of watching from the sidelines and uh figuring out alongside everybody else. I also don't think that it's just Elon uh bought a bunch of Dogecoin and tweets about it because he thinks it's going to a dollar and he's gonna, you know, make money, right. Like, I don't think, I don't think it's an economic argument as to why he's so interested in it. I think it's much more, uh it's almost like meta message for a lot of other stuff."
