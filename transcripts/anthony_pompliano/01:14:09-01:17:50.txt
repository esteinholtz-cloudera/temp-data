  "Text": "me sort of make a few comments. It's kind of interesting. So you're exactly right., maybe the blowback is part of the mechanism that actually develops these ideas and so on. I do want to kind of speak to a little bit of the toxicity that I've experienced in the Bitcoin community. I kind of see it, the Bitcoin community. I think it paints a really nice picture which I kind of see it as an immune system that protects against the viruses that are bad ideas. that said the immune system can destroy a body, right? Uh And uh the thing you mentioned about Eric and maybe about myself and in general, just people exploring ideas there is a Dunning Kruger effect, which is when you first start exploring ideas deeply, you have um overblown level of confidence about how much you understand. And that's actually the process about learning. Then you realize you don't understand much. What I've noticed with the Bitcoin community is they're not as patient with the basics of the Dunning Cougar effect. Like if I step in and declarative statements about Bitcoin, like, you know, I read a long time ago, the white paper at the cursory level, I felt that I understand the technology that says basic intuitions. I didn't think about the social dynamics. I didn't think about any financial implications and a lot of the deep actually the ongoing innovations and all that kind of stuff. But I thought I understood that technology and so I step in and make declarative statements. I think those are the, first time you say, OK, what's the role of Bitcoin in the world? You start thinking about it deeply and then you make statements, the toxicity that you get in those first few statements is really a putting to me, I'm somebody that tries to communicate love and live that with everything I do. And there is a level of disrespect that I've experienced not directly just observing others. People have been mostly kind to me and I appreciate that. But you're going to criticize me about my exploration of ideas in Bitcoin, have to also acknowledge that I'm a human being. They got a phd and stuff like I did some hard shit that it could be in farming or it could be in whatever I've lived life. And I've really thought deeply and I really care. I know a lot of shit and it's possible that I actually have a lot of ideas that you can learn from.. If it's agriculture fine or if it's artificial intelligence, fine. Like I know what I'm talking about about certain things and I could be wrong about a lot of things and there's an exchange of ideas. That's, that makes that mechanism that you talked about more efficient. Sometimes when the blowback is too strong, too early on the development of ideas is just inefficient. And I'm not sure if there's a, you know, the way it was explained to me is that for so long community was bombarded with just like bad ideas, like criticisms, they're just overly sensitive now to like bullshit to, they're like triggered by statements like they've heard it all before and they're like, oh there they go again with the same old arguments. that doesn't mean that, you know, you have to sort of, I guess, develop patience and so on, especially when you feel like in my case that the person is coming from a good place, right? I don't know if there's something you could say that's positive about the future of this kind of overcome this toxicity. I think there's a"
