  "Text": "? I think there was two main takeaways that I took. Right. So one was, um, not a specific moment, but on multiple occasions, I remember we were driving down the road and I would look, and there would be a 1012, 14 year old kid. if you've never seen somebody who literally has hate and disdain in their eyes, you just not necessarily to you personally, just to the uniform, to what you stand for it, to all this stuff. When you see it, you see it. Right. And I always think of, um, if you've ever watched the movie, uh, 12 Strong and in it, uh, they've got this Afghan Afghanistan warlord and he's talking to a bunch of soldiers and he says, you know, you don't have killer eyes, you do, you do. And he's just like he can just tell. Right? He's, he's seen so many soldiers. so I think that that was a, a memory on a number of occasions where I just saw young kids and I just said they hate us, right? And, and it's not you personally, it's what you stand for. the, the really big event was, um, when you first get to, uh, these combat zones, a lot of times what will happen is, uh, you basically, your unit teams up with a unit that's leaving and there's a handoff and it happens over a couple of weeks. And so you can imagine almost, you know, 1% of our team goes out with 99% of their team, then 5, 95 1090 all the way till it's 5050 then eventually it rotates and then it's majority of our team and a small number of their team. so what a lot of people will explain is the two most dangerous times in war are actually the first two or three weeks in the last two or three weeks when you first get there, you don't know who the people are. You don't know the terrain, you don't know, you know, kind of the local cultures and, and uh who to look out for what signs, all that kind of stuff. And the last two or three weeks is you basically think you've survived the deployment, you're looking forward to going home. So you become complacent and things like that. so we made it through that transition period with no issues. Uh But the literally the very first mission, uh that we went out as a team ourselves 100%. Um was two separate incidents. Uh One was, we were driving in the middle of the night and, uh, what we think was a sniper shot at, uh, a truck that I was in, I was standing up outside of it, uh, along with a, uh another guy and that was kind of just a wake up call again of, I've never been shot at before. Right? And so I'll never forget, uh, you kinda heard this whiz go by. And the guy next to me was from, uh, rural Pennsylvania. And he just said, you know, look, I've never been shot at before either, but I've done a lot of hunting, get the fuck down. Ok. so, uh, we kept driving that night. Um, and, uh, later on in the night, uh, an IED went off, a guy ran over an IED, uh, who was at the front of the convoy. And when that IED went off, uh, again, I had never been in a convoy that had been blown up before, but the training kicks in. And so immediately every single person starts screaming out iedied and they start looking and trying to figure it out and, and you realize the United States military did a fantastic job training us before we went in that moment, nobody thought about anything. You just did what you had been programmed to do. Um And so ultimately, kind of through the end of that event, uh, there was a US soldier that ended up dying. He was shot in the head. And, um, when we got back to the base, uh, kind of after that entire event, I think it just hit us. We are at war and if we make mistakes here, that is the cost of, you know, kind of those mistakes. this was somebody who I didn't know, uh, it was somebody who literally showed up, uh, kind of as secondary support uh for our unit. And basically uh was there to help us, right? And so it was one of those weird situations where uh you have this emotional connection because it's somebody who uh shared an event with you, but you didn't know them, right? And you learn their name later and you understand that they have a family and they have young kids and all this stuff. And so again, as a 20 year old kid, you're kind of processing all this and you just realize like gun I have in my arm, my hands, it's real for a reason, right? And we better take this seriously. This is not, you know, us joking around in kind of the barracks and you know, all the things that you would expect, you know, guys are doing in the army. So I think that was like the moment where I said, hey, I'm gonna learn a lot here. Uh and I gotta make sure I get home and"
