  "Text": "two important caveats to this one is I didn't, you know, buy some Bitcoin in 2011 or 12, right? And then all of a sudden it appreciated a bunch and it grew into that. But uh from a cost basis perspective, you know, put $100 and now it's a ton of money. What I did was I basically in 2018, um, saw Bitcoin from a US dollar price standpoint was falling and falling and falling. And in December of 2018, I said, take about 50% of my net worth and convert it from dollar denominated assets into Bitcoin. So it was a very kind of intentional decision with a very specific view on the world as to like why I was doing it. I then essentially just let it sit there grow, whatever until uh the spring of 2020 when I saw the government step in and start to say, hey, we're going to really be aggressive in terms of interest rate manipulation and quantitative easing. I then decided to go ahead and take basically the remainder and start to convert it as well. So it became very aggressive in doing that. And so the way that I look at it is that's actually my savings. Right. And so in some weird way, if I said to, you know, what's the dollar worth, you'd say, well, a $1 bill is worth $1 right?, to me, I denominate my wealth in Bitcoin. So I think of one Bitcoin is worth one Bitcoin. Not one Bitcoin is worth 60,000 or 55,000 or 70,000, right? I denominate everything in Bitcoin when I'm making a purchase in my head, I'm calculating how much Bitcoin am I spending right now. Right. Well, guess what happens when you have a devaluing currency as the denominator matter, right? Like you, you're financially incentivized to spend or invest to consume uh when you have an appreciating currency, all of a sudden, you become much less consumptive in your behavior because you're actually trading off future purchasing power for the consumption today."
