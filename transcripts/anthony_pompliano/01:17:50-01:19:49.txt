  "Text": "of trends that are all kind of coalescing here in these types of experiences. So one when you look at a community, there's always um a spectrum, right? In terms of there's some people who over index on kindness and stupidity and there's some people who over index on intelligence and basically just being an asshole, right? And then you get everyone in between. And so like uh naturally, as we know the extremist ends of any community end up being the loudest usually, right? The second thing is um is from the outsider view on like at the beginning of the exploration of ideas, uh it's very much a learning process, right? It's, it's, I don't know if I understand this or not, but here's ideas, A B and C from the internal perspective, there's a trillion dollars of value at stake and we must protect it with our lives, right? truth is probably somewhere in between there, right? And again, the world's not black and white, there's, there's this kind of more gray area that I think actually um is where most people exist. The other thing that's at play here is uh I think the Bitcoin community understands the internet and internet culture and uh narratives better than almost anyone. And so you see this with kind of the uh the just complete destruction of narratives with memes and, and um the the visceral reaction and the use of things like Reddit and Twitter and youtube podcast, just areas where um I think a lot about uh if you are an upstart, right? And you are going to go challenge the most uh well respected elite, uh kind of establishment institutions in the world. If you walk in in a suit and tie and you say I'm here to debate you with ideas, gonna get your clock cleaned, right? Because they're gonna try to help their lawyers, their regulators, their lobbyists, right? Like all this stuff, you instead say I'm going to meme you to death on the internet and I'm going to control the public narrative,"
