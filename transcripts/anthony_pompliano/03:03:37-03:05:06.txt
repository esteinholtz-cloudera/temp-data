  "Text": "answered in a way that um isn't meant to be accurate. It's meant to um the right answer for me, which is ultimately, you know, and I talked to a lot of people who always ask like, what's the, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? I say it's to be happy the reason why I think of it that way is I've got a friend Jonathan Geller who talks about uh know, enough being enough. And recently he talked about it in the context of Bitcoin. And so Bitcoins are have two things, any Bitcoin. If you talk to them, they believe the same two things. One, they don't want the US dollar price to go up because they actually want to acquire more Bitcoin, right and then, then like, once they feel like they've got enough, but two is no matter how much they own, they think that they don't own enough and they want to acquire more. And so some point you say to yourself, what is enough and I think that the whole meaning of life is to understand kind of what your level of satisfaction is. And for some people, that's a monetary thing. Some people that's a freedom of time thing. For some people, it's an impact thing, whatever, but just understanding that's important and then going and accomplishing it. And what I've found is that people who I know who have done this and been intentional about it, they accomplish it on a much shorter timeline than people who don't. Right. There's some people who start thinking about when they're 60 naturally, you're not gonna accomplish it before you're 60. If you just start thinking about it at 60 people who sort of thinking about it earlier can do it. And so I think that's really it, for me, it's just like the meaning of life is to enjoy it the way"
