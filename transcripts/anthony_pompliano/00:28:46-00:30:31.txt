  "Text": ". I think you have to separate out intention from action. So if you talk to some of the most heinous criminals in the world, they've rationalized their actions. so you've got to ask yourself what is the level of which they understood what they were doing that they intended to be malicious, nefarious. Um and, and kind of do bad things versus the actual actions themselves. And so um even as a society, you know, if, let's say, for example, you were to walk down the street and you were to murder somebody on the sidewalk completely unprovoked, would look at you and say you are a, you know, a sociopath, uh you have everything wrong with you and that is somebody that we do not want in our society. And therefore we will levy, you know, the extent of rule of law against you in order to protect society from you, right? And you become that monster, that beast. in the same situation, somebody walks in your house with a knife and you murder them or you kill them. Now we put you up on a pedestal as a hero. there are two very, very different responses. They may be just as morbid, they may be just as violent, uh in terms of the actual actions, the intentions, the way it's perceived is very, very different. And so I, I think that uh as a world, we like a very black and white clean cut, you know, good, bad. Uh I think the world's a lot more messy than that. And I think that uh a lot of times when you look at intention, it's hard for us to tell what somebody's intention is. But looked at a lot of, you know, people who are both considered very good and also a lot of people are considered very bad they sound very similar in terms of the motivations for their actions. And so I think that it's just a really hard problem that probably doesn't have a perfect solution or an answer."
