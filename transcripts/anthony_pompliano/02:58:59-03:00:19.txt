  "Text": "with capital is definitely probably my favorite book um books that have been impactful. I read when I was 20 actually sitting in the desert of Iraq, um rich dad, poor dad thinking grow rich and the richest man in Babylon. I don't think I took a single thing and like implemented it from like an execution standpoint. Uh But it was a complete shift in mentality and understanding a relationship with money and, and um just kind of what I wanted to do with my life and stuff like that. So I think those three books and I read them in succession were really impactful. Um And then I think one of the best books probably ever written is, uh I think it's called, uh when Breath becomes air. Um or air becomes breath. I can't remember. But it's basically a doctor or a medical professional who's dying and he essentially writes about the experience and thoughts and kind of all the stuff. And think that it's just uh one of these things where if you said to me, you know, what's the number one thing I took out of my experience in Iraq? a book like that also gives you is we're all gonna die, right? And you and I can want to be as immortal as we want, but at some point we're gonna die. And so it really does kind of focus you on time being that scarce asset and use it for enjoyment and happiness. Um More so than anything else. And I think that's part of your message and, and it's a great one."
