  "Text": "if you then say to yourself, OK, how does the uh the pricing um kind of cycles work, right? Or, or the boom and bust cycles. is a very um kind of linear type supply schedule, meaning that uh there is a certain amount of gold that comes out of the ground each year. The inter year variation in that incoming supply is not much, right? Maybe there's an extra mining company that gets set up or a couple of them, maybe one goes out of business. But for the most part, the kind of inflationary uh increase to the supply of gold is pretty stagnant. Uh year over year, has a very unique feature which every four years there is a programmatic supply shock, meaning that uh in the beginning 50 Bitcoin every 10 minutes was introduced into the supply. After four years of that happening every 10 minutes, it was cut in half. So on a in a single moment, it went from 50 to now it was 25 4 years every 10 minutes, 25 got cut in half again to 12.5. And then recently in May 2020 got cut to 6.25. you have an asset that is determined the price based on supply and demand, you normally have two inputs to the equation. What is the supply and what is the demand an asset like gold or a stock or anything else? We have to do our best guess at the supply. Both the existing supply and the incoming supply and do our best guess at the demand. And we're actually pretty good at this a lot of times in terms of directionally saying it's gonna go up or down. And here's kind of some price point milestones. is unique in that there's 100% verifiable proof of the existing supply, the total supply and the incoming daily supply. So we know 100% I can show you on the actual Blockchain uh or in the code that there's 21 million Bitcoin. And that's all there will ever be. I can show you that there's 18.6 million give or take uh Bitcoin that actually are in circulation today, right? And I can go all the way back to show every single transaction that's ever occurred since January through two and nine. then I can show you on a daily basis that 900 Bitcoin a day are coming into the circulating supply. And so when you have 100% confidence, because you can prove the supply side of this equation, you can hold it constant. I know with 100% accuracy, the supply side. So now I've reduced the mathematical equation that I need to do to determine price movements to a 50% reduction. I only have to worry about demand. I don't have to worry about supply. so when I look at demand, I can do all kinds of things. I can take the demand over the last 10 years and the growth and just extrapolate it out, I can increase it, I can decrease it whatever. what you find is that the supply shocks lead to significant price appreciation as the asset gets repriced because there there's a supply shock to them. so probably the best thing that I've done over the last couple of years was in 2019. I started to talk about the idea that we were going to have both the supply shock and the demand shock in 2021 or I'm sorry, in 2020 didn't know when this bull market that we were in was gonna end. Nobody knows. Right. It's impossible to time these things. But you could tell that we were kind of at late stages of a cycle, there was inverted yield curves. There was re uh gyrations in the repo markets. A lot of CEO s leaving their jobs, you know, all this kind of stuff. all I said was at some point when the market turns over, the government's gonna have to step in, we were addicted to stimulus. They're gonna have to manipulate interest rates down and they're gonna have to print money. I had no clue that there was gonna be a global pandemic that they were gonna have to step in, in such an aggressive way and move rates, not down but down to zero. And that they not only were gonna print hundreds of billions, but they could print trillions of dollars. the framework that I used to think about this was when they do that, everyone is gonna run to store value assets. They're gonna run the gold, they're gonna run the Bitcoin et cetera. And right as they do that, it appears at the same time there's gonna be this supply shock. So you're gonna get a supply shock and a demand shock that are both positive for the, the price and I call it rocket fuel for Bitcoin., it happened and here we are, now look for it and I say, ok, we are likely going to see 100,000 Bitcoin, $100,000 Bitcoin this year at some point. I don't know when it happens, but we're moving in that in 20"
