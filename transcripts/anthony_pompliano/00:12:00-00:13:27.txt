  "Text": "think America was very, very good at exporting the violence elsewhere for a long time. And there was this element of complacency, but also this element of uh you know, really just American superiority that doesn't happen here. Right? And uh I think that that woke people up not only to um kind of the idea that other places around the world may not like the American ideals may not like democracy and capitalism and, that, but also, uh maybe we aren't as big, tough and secure as we thought we were, right? And so obviously, I think you see the kind of the over rotation with a lot of the kind of security theater that came after that of almost psychologically, let's make our citizens feel like they're safe, even if the things that we're doing don't necessarily, you know, kind of change that apparatus. But on top of that, I think that it really woke people up to uh extremism around the world. And uh I don't know if necessarily there was a change in the extremism as much as it just was an awareness thing, right? How, how many people, you know, kind of drew a line from, was it 92 or 93 with the uh World Trade Center bombing to, you know, deep levels of extremism and hatred of uh kind of the American? Probably not that many 2001. A lot of people. And so I think that was, you know, again, as a, as a young kid, you don't understand a lot of this stuff. You basically just, hey, somebody came here and tried to kill Americans. And so, you know, we should go fight back, right? Was kind of the, uh, the, the response I think that I had,"
