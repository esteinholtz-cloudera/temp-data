  "Text": "we look at um what I'll just consider the legends of Wall Street in general, right? Um There's no denying that they're incredibly intelligent. Uh There's no denying that actually, especially in the hedge fund world, they're some of the most open minded people uh in terms of they're willing to change their mind when they get new information. There's no doubt that they are historians in the sense of having studied financial markets and cycles over time. And also uh one of the things that I really respect about all those guys is almost all of them are willing to put ideas out uh via various writings that they do uh and accept the public criticism, right? Whether it's Howard Marks Ray or others, uh They will put this stuff out in public and uh sure there's a lot of people who um are supportive and, and kind of are part of a fan base if you will. Uh But there's a lot of people who also think that sometimes they say stupid things and so putting that out takes kind of courage, right? I think Ray is actually the most fascinating though, out of all of these kind of legends of Wall Street in that. Um he understands debt cycles, he understands currencies. He for a while now has been all over. Uh and famously said, you know, cash is trash, uh investable assets, right? He just, he kind of like just knew all of it. And for a long time, Bitcoin have said, right? You understand the Bitcoin argument, you're just missing the last part, which is Bitcoin is the solution, right? so he was gold and some other ideas. But I think that he's a perfect example of when you are part of the establishment, people view you in a very static way as the leader of a part of establishment. whether it's Bill Gates, Ray Dalio or somebody else, each one of these people were innovators and challengers to a system. They were upstarts at one point. And so it's kind of this idea that like if you live long enough, you eventually become the man. And so, you know, Gates is a good example, right, Warren Buffett is a good example, Ray Dalio is a good example, et cetera. And so uh you have to give credit, I think to Dalio in the sense of he kept an open mind about him, of this. And more so than many of his peers has continued to do the work and come around to this idea. Uh And now I don't want to know if I wanted to say that he's a Bitcoin proponent as much as he believes it is one of, you know, a portion of assets that can be a solution. so to me, when you start to convince those types of people, when it's, you know, Paul Tudor Jones or Stanley Druckenmiller, Ray Dalio, uh, Howard marks now, even writing about it saying, hey, you know, I was anti Bitcoin. I didn't put a ton of intellectual rigor into it, but thank God, my son bought a bunch for our family, right? And uh, and kind of we've had exposure to it. think what it does is more than anything. It's not going to convince somebody to go and um, you know, take it seriously or uh go ahead and make an allocation, it reduces career risk. And so if all of a sudden when Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller come out and say, hey, I own Bitcoin and here's why every other investor on Wall Street now can say to an investment committee. Well, it's good enough for Paul Tudor Jones. It's good enough for Stanley Druck and Miller. so I think that it's very interesting because Ray doesn't just represent Wall Street. I think Ray in some weird way, represents this like macro economic investor. And so some of those are in hedge funds and some of those uh people would be like cio s at organizations, some of them would be at corporations and some of them are just kind of retail investors. so you can see this um kind of inflection point throughout the adoption of Bitcoin, right? There was infrastructure that got built, ok. That kind of led to more adoption. There was a certain individuals, right? Usually they were kind of um technology oriented, entrepreneurial building, they would buy it and come out and say, OK, that led to inflection points. Uh You started to have some of these kind of Wall Street legends come out, sort of financial institutions started and now you're seeing corporations start to do it, right? Eventually there's going to be a central bank that does it. And so you kind of walk through that line and what you understand it like it's the same thing every time it's just somebody new, right? That, that path, right? That that Bitcoin journey if you will. And think that that is almost the beauty of it is uh if you short circuit the journey, it's almost like somebody doesn't appreciate it, right? If you take, let's say somebody who's a young kid and you just give them a bunch of money and they didn't have to work hard for it. don't really appreciate it."
