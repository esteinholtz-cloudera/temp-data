  "Text": "lot of times when we would talk about it, we were there. If I was that kid, I would want to kill that person too. Right. I, I would have hatred as well. Right. Imagine if in the United States tomorrow you and I woke up and there was tanks rolling down the street from another country and they were basically imposing their rules on us whether they thought it was the right thing to do or not, the soldiers were there. They were doing this. would probably feel not so great about it. Right. At, at, at kind of a minimum and at a maximum we'd be really, really pissed off, we would fight back. And so what you don't understand when you're in the heat of the moment is why does this person feel this way? And so What's very weird is, well, what happens if a year ago us soldiers came through, they got shot at, they returned fire and they killed that kid's uncle. be pissed off. Right. And so you just start to understand like we look at war, very black and white. We look at it very much from a clinical perspective. We're gonna go, we're gonna go, um, kind of invade somewhere. Uh, we are the most dominant military in the world. We're very good at invading. Uh And we will crush wherever we invade. when you're actually on the ground, what you understand is the humanity of it. All right. And so what becomes very interesting is, um pretty much every veteran I know that comes back. They're some of the largest pacifists in the world and I always revert back to uh Marcus Latrell uh who was a famous Navy Seal. Um And uh there's a movie made about him and his story. Uh he gave a speech one time uh that I saw and he basically said, listen, you're a politician, your job is to be the diplomat, do everything you possibly can not to send me and my friends anywhere because when you send us, we're gonna bring hell with us, right? And understand that is the business that we are in. But every single other person up until we get sent has a job to do to prevent having to send us. And I think that ultimately, that's where you see a lot of kind of this generation that has fought in Iraq and Afghanistan that says, listen, we shouldn't be running around the world being the police, maybe we shouldn't be going and invading all these different countries because when you actually get to see firsthand what happens, it's just something that we should avoid at all costs. But if we have to go or we have to actually send soldiers somewhere, understand what happens when that occurs. And you know, the United States is the best in the world of doing it."
