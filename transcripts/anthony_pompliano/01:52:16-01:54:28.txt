  "Text": "of like if I said to you, you know, hey, we're going to go buy an asset and you never went and you looked at it, you never went and, uh, you know, made a decision, like, sure, maybe I did it or I didn't do it, but like you didn't actually experience it, right? And so I think that that's the important part. second thing is uh each person is different from a um how they view this asset. So there are some people who are speculating, right? There's three use cases for Bitcoin, there's store value, medium of exchange and speculation and the people who are speculating, they can't put it in deep cold storage because they need to be able to trade it. So what ends up happening is they fall in the bucket of like high risk, high reward, they're trying to trade, they're trying to do all these things and sure maybe there are profits that they can generate if they're good at it. But also they're introducing a lot of risk. so that person is very different than the person who says, hey, you know, I bought one Bitcoin and I'm gonna save it for my child, right? And I'm gonna give it to him on their 18th birthday. And so when you start to look at this, what you end up saying is what are you actually purchasing this for kind of like, why are you doing it? And then what's your time horizon? what ends up happening is more and more people in the Bitcoin community have longer time horizons. One of the advantages to uh this community, right? If you look at uh the on chain metrics, 60% of Bitcoin haven't moved uh from the digital wall in which they sit in the last 12 months. So even though it's appreciated hundreds of percent on the upside, there's been lots of volatility, a 50% drop in a single day in terms of the US dollar price still doesn't move. And so these are the kind of the long term holders, right? These are the the Iron Fist or, or uh as has become popular, the Diamond Hands, right? Diamond Hands, they're just, they're not going anywhere. And so I think that those people are much more likely to not have their Bitcoin on exchanges or in software walls. They've got it in some sort of like highly secure environment. Uh and what and one in which they have deep sovereignty or, or um kind of a prevalent sovereignty. And the reason for that is because they have that long time horizon, they don't want to be um kind of convicted around sound money macro environment. All stuff and then they make a mistake because they trusted, you know, ABC D company. Uh and that counter party risk because it ends up actually being, you know, fatal or, or detrimental."
