  "Text": ". So war I think has like very negative connotations in terms of bullets and bombs and death and, and kind of just very morbid type. Um um understanding. On the other hand, I think people look at and say, of course, there will always be conflict, right? You, you just can't have billions of people all on the same planet without some level of disagreement, whether that's a disagreement of ideas, disagreement over physical, you know, geography, uh or something else. And so I think conflict will always exist. question is, what form does war take, moving forward. And so in my mind, you know, it's starting to look a lot more clinical. Right. A lot more drones, a lot less soldiers on the ground. Uh, a lot more use of special forces and kind of these small, highly specialized teams rather than kind of big mechanical armies. Um, and then you get into like the information warfare and kind of cyber warfare and you start to understand that at war with a lot of people right now. Right? Doesn't mean we're necessarily dropping bombs, uh, on their countries, doesn't necessarily mean we're sending soldiers there, but on a daily basis, we are engaged in these kind of, you know, cyber battlefields. And so if that's where war starts to play out, um, it the tools and tactics and techniques that uh we need to arm our country and other countries will arm themselves with. But it also changes the way that we think about war, right? It, it sounds a lot less, uh, worrisome if I say, hey, we're gonna go to war with a country, but by the way, there's gonna be no death,? Ok. Like that doesn't sound nearly as bad as, hey, we're gonna go send 10,000 soldiers and, you know, some percentage of them are gonna die on the battlefield. And then we're gonna, you know, basically pipe back videos and articles saying that American soldiers are dying,"
