  "Text": "think you got to start with Bitcoin Standard. Uh That one to me feels like uh it really lays out the picture nicely. There is uh Bitcoin uh money, you can't fuck with, it was written by our friend Jason Williams. Uh As you can imagine, it's basically what it talks about. Uh There's another book, Layered Money. Um It's written by Nick who uh who's done a great uh great job kind of laying it out. Um There's a book uh called Bitcoin In Black America, written by a guy Isaiah Jackson. And he basically lays out the argument for why uh the black community um can benefit in a uh asymmetric way from something like Bitcoin. And there's a whole bunch more, I'm gonna forget them all. Um There's the, uh I think it's called The Cost of Tomorrow. A Guy, Jeff Booth, uh Jeff Booth wrote it. Um And just if you get on Twitter, basically, you're gonna see all these books flying around. Um But I do have to say that uh from a psychological concept uh or philosophical concept. The number one book that I've ever read uh that aligns with Bitcoin ethos, but doesn't say a word about Bitcoin is a book called the Dow of Capital by Mark Spitznagel. so what he essentially does is he just reiterates over and over and over again, long term thinking outliers, disruption, all the stuff. And so he's a guy who uh he runs a fund uh that essentially they just do uh tail risk hedging. so in, you know, March or February of 2020 they're up like 4000% right by the way they pretty much lose money, you know, for 89 years, then that happens. And so, uh but they're still one of the best performing funds if you look at it over, you know, years and years. And so it's just this mindset of, uh everyone is so short term focused. And so I think it's just a great reminder to long term thinking."
