  "Text": ", we're moving from a world of conflict surrounded and determined by bombs, bullets and soldiers to a battlefield that is determined by war of information and cyber capabilities. And so in that virtual world, it about death and destruction of human life and the physical analog world? Or will it become more important to attack or defend virtual property and virtual life? And you know, some level of virtual sovereignty, my opinion, the latter is more likely. And so what you start to understand is, well, what do you truly value in your life? it the physical analog, materialistic consumptive goods is it virtual? in many cases something as simple as the ability to connect with somebody is really important. so one of the most disruptive combative violent things that a country may do to another country in the future, simply take down the internet. Mhm. put people in isolation., I don't need to physically harm you if I can psychologically harm you. I don't need to. Yeah, I don't need to uh actually convince you through a monopoly on violence on physical violence. if I can psychologically change the way you see the world through misinformation through all sorts of nefarious activities? And I think that, you know, the United States has been struggling with this idea over the last couple of years in the political arena. But what happens when it starts to come to other aspects of our life?"
