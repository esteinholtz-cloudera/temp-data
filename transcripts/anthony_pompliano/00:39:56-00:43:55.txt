  "Text": "talk about Bitcoin first and then it'll help us use as a kind of a comparison to Ethereum or, or whatever else. So when you think about what is money, right? That's kind of the first question, people really kind of go down the rabbit hole on And ultimately today it's a belief system, right? And you may believe that one currency has more value over another it's backed by a certain military or uh a certain government has a monetary policy that you believe in or don't believe in. Um But ultimately, it's a belief system that there's nothing backing this. Uh other than uh a government asks you to pay your taxes in it, right? And they can have a monopoly on violence. Uh in terms of they can put you in jail if you don't pay your taxes, uh they can go to other countries and they can invade and do all this stuff. wasn't always like that, right? It was historically, a layer of one technology was gold. And so gold was a fantastic store of value. You knew that if you held gold, it wasn't gonna be inflated away. It was sound of money, it was outside the system and no one could create more of it. The reason why that's important is because that optimization for store of value served as the bedrock of the entire stack of uh money uh for 5000 years. so the problem with that though, again, trade off between store of value is it was really hard to transact with, right? If I came in here and I, and you said, hey, I want a couple of ounces of gold and I had a whole bar, I'd have to literally shave off the ounces of gold. Uh It's heavy to carry around. If you said to me, hey, you're in one city, mail it to me, it really expensive. You know, there's all these issues with it. so ultimately, what people said was, well, let's create a second layer on top of that gold in order to make it easier to transact. And so we created paper claims on the gold. So, hey, don't carry around the gold in your pocket anymore. Put it in a vault or a bank, they're going to issue a, a paper claim. Now, you and I can trade these paper claims around and at any point if you want the gold, you just show up and you say, hey, give me, you know, three ounces of gold or two bars or whatever. And so that actually made the store of value. It was it allowed that to be the anchor and kind of the most important part, the security of your, of your purchasing power. now it became easier to transact. And then eventually we built layers even on top of that. So everything from electronic money, uh kind of electronic CS all the way to credit and other systems on top of that gold, 1971 comes around and obviously we d peg from that gold, right? And it was a temporary measure at the time, we ended up not going back to it. so what you moved uh or transition from was sound money, which was outside the system, no one could create more. So now the government had full control, they could create as much as they wanted to. Uh they tried to be responsible and disciplined, but obviously hard to do. Sometimes we've been really good at it. Sometimes we've been less good at it and you go around the world and some countries have absolutely sucked at it and some have been good at it. so when you look into the Bitcoin world, I think that when you look at the optimization for security similar to gold store value, people hold it. Purchasing power has gone up a lot year over year, it's like a 200% year, over year, compound annual growth uh for over a decade, right? And so you measure this in kind of the US dollar exchange price, et cetera. But there's still a lot of people who will yell and scream about it's slow, it's costly, right? All the things around those transactions that are obstacles or challenges. so there's basically two schools of thought and this is where we kind of get into the bifurcation. Some people just said, hey, this technology is antiquated, we can't use it, it doesn't make sense. Uh And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go build something new and so you go get, you know, kind of all of the various versions there. Bitcoin community says, no, just like gold had paper claims and other things built on top in layer 2345, we're going to do that here. And so they've already started to build kind of this layer two where it's easier to transact, it's cheaper, it's faster, et cetera. And so I actually think that both of those worlds are going to coexist in the future. The big question is just which one has more importance, right? So again, get out of binary, it's just probabilistically. so my personal belief is that the security that the store of value component as the bedrock for a monetary system is essential, right? Like that is the most important thing because you can always improve the other components, but you can't go back and fix that kind of core piece."
