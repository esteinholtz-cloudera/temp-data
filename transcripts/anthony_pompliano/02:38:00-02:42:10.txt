  "Text": "? Think there's probably both things happening fad and things to learn, right? And um we just start with like what is an NFT? It's a non fungible token, meaning that um there's no fung. Fung is a fancy word. Um I always describe it as if I took $100 bill and I put it on the table with a bunch of other $100 bills and we mixed them up and I just grabbed $100 bill and left. I'm no worse. As long as they're all, you know, uh official $100 bills because as long as I have $100 I have $100 I don't need that exact same bill back. So that means that those $100 bills are fungible, fungible would be like art if I took a Picasso and I put it down on the table and you brought three artists that no one's ever heard of before and we mixed them up and I just took any random piece of art and it wasn't the Picasso I lose because the Picasso is really important there, right? So non fungible is important in art. these non fungible tokens essentially are doing is they are uh creating scarcity and originality in a digital environment. And what I mean by that is um take a music file if I had a music file and you wanted it, you said send it to me, I press, send it essentially creates a copy and you get one music file, I get another. We don't care, you can listen to music, I can listen to music. We're super happy I instead though have a digital file, that entire premise is based on scarcity I hit send and you get a copy and I keep the original or you get the original, I get a copy. There's a problem. And so ultimately, what I think is playing out with NFTS is it's a technology regardless of where it plays out from blockchains or uh what in communities or environments just brings true digital scarcity to the internet. so naturally, what do people do? They look at the legacy world and they say, well, what's scarce there that has value, how do we bring that to the digital world? So art is a perfect example, right? And you know, frankly last year, I started to look at this because it felt like this was going to be really, really big. the conclusion I came to was just as Bitcoin is gonna be bigger than gold, right? The digital application of something is gonna be bigger than the analog application. The same thing is gonna be true in art. The digital art world is gonna be bigger than the nutritional art world. People think that sounds crazy. At first until you start to realize very, very similar. The art is more portable, it can be divisible, right? It's got a larger demand market in terms of the internet rather than an auction, right? All this kind of stuff when you display it, it can have motion and music and all of these aspects to it that are better than the traditional art. the traditional art market has that the digital art market has not had is the narrative, narrative based world scarcity kind of in digital uh sense. so I think the entire world is going through right now is an exploration of how do we use this technology to create new things? Frankly, we're not going to be good at it for a while. so the only place I've really focused on is digital art itself. And I've always been interested in art, but I wasn't gonna go buy a painting and hang it on the wall right in the sense of, uh that's how I was gonna store value. What I find fascinating though is that I now can take that concept, which most of the wealthiest people in the world have a significant portion. Some, you know, some people have 20% in terms of, you know, number of billionaires, 20% of their wealth is in art you can bring to this digital realm, which is much more um kind of natural to a digital native. so the best way I know how to describe the importance is imagine a serial number being placed on something. Take the Eiffel Tower, only Eiffel Tower that has value is the first one, every replica of it, regardless of size location, you know, who made it where they sent it, they have no value. Tower 001 is the most important. And so I think that's ultimately what we're starting to see here and what we're looking at is probably 1% of what it's going to grow into."
