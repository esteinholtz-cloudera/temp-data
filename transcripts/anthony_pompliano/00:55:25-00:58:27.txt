  "Text": "I and everyone else in the world has lived in a narrative driven world for the last couple of decades, right? And what the internet and digital technologies have done is it opened up the possibility and the desire from people to have a world now where I can validate things. So when I see that headline, want to see you say whatever happened in the news, if you're the subject of the news rather than have somebody else tell me the story. If I see that you say something is scarce, prove to me that it is scarce. And so I think that's kind of a psychological shift. The younger generation is starting to understand because ultimately you and I probably grew up in a world where our parents could tell us a story and we just believed it. know, dad or mom says it, it must be true. If my brother heard a story, what does he do? He goes to Google and he looks it up, right? He comes back and usually tells my parents that you got the story wrong, right. And so I think that that that provability or that that validation ends up becoming really, really important. And so, you know, look at something like gold, I think that people are drastically underestimating the shift that's underway right now. Gold is one down in value since April or I'm sorry, August of 2020. so in a time frame where central banks have had historic quantitative easing literally $6 trillion in the United States, the one asset that historically has been the best store of value and has uh you know, in 2008 financial crisis hit an all time high based on the the government response has actually suffered uh uh for a main part of this uh financial crisis, then look at central banks around the world who have been very large holders of gold for a long time and net buyers on a monthly basis for multiple months. Over the last six months, they've been net sellers of gold and then you start to look at jewelry demand. So the actual non monetary value of gold and that demand for gold jewelry peaked in 2013 and has continued to fall since. so what you start to say to yourself is take just the asset of gold which about $10 trillion market cap and you say, OK, well, jewelry demand continues to fall even if it's at a slight rate, but it continues to contract. You have central banks that now at sometimes are net sellers and sometimes net buyers, right? So, OK, again, contraction there and then from the investment standpoint, the actual price that the daily uh price of this continues to fall, which is a signal that there's a contracting demand from an investment perspective, 93% of all use of gold, only 7% of its used for actual technology and metal conduction and things like that. so you have a $10 trillion asset that it appears and again, maybe data changes and I'll change my mind and other people change their mind, but it appears is on the decline. And so if that happens, you're going to get the contraction of a $10 trillion asset, where's all that value go? And what you're seeing is at the same time that that asset is contracting, also seeing a massive influx from not only retail investors, not only uh kind of the wealthy and the elite, but also from financial institutions, corporations, pension funds, et cetera into this kind of digital sound money. So you're"
