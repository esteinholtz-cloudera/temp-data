  "Text": ", I probably do. It's like taking a CD ROM trying to put an MP3 player into streaming., but I think that the reason why that becomes really interesting is when you start to create these digital assets, now you open up the world of possibilities. So when new technology is created, you can do two things, you can either create new things, the world's never seen before or you can use it to improve the old world, most people because it's the easiest thing to think about want to improve the old world. So an equivalent of this would be uh when the internet came along, a media company that had newspapers would say, hey, we should take a PDF of the newspaper and we should put it on a website. now anyone in the world can go to this website and they can read the newspaper today that was valuable, it missed out on the ability to change headlines, to test, to put multimedia, to distribute it differently to, you know, do all kinds of things that today we understand the internet really empowered. And so what I think we're about to watch happen is we're going to digitize the assets. We're gonna put them all into these uh digital wallets. You're gonna get automated technologies where machines can transact with each other. And we're gonna do simple things like why do we pay people once every two weeks? don't we just pay them at the end of every day or why don't I literally stream payments to you on an hour by hour basis based on the work you do, it would solve incredible economic issues in our country and in countries around the world. But historically, businesses can't do this because of the technology problem. They can't keep track of it all. How do they pay everyone every day? How do they pay everyone every hour? Like you just can't do it."
