  "Text": "I don't know all the details. But what I will say is I've listened to a number of his podcasts and him and there's a whole bunch of people like him. basically put them in the bucket of, they're an independent thinker who are courageous enough to speak their truth, whatever that may be, uh they are humble enough to uh revisit their ideas and say I got this right. I got this wrong information changed. I'll change my mind. It's obviously a sign of intelligence to be able to do that type of stuff. I actually think that one of the most scarce things in our society are those independent thinkers who are able to do all this right of scarcity. Yeah. And so to me, uh I put Eric and the whole host of other people, kind of uh if you look at like the intellectual dark web is kind of a label that's been used. actually some of the most important people in our society because they're the people who are willing to stand up against the mass kind of thought process, they're willing to talk about things that others may think are taboo. Right. They're willing to change their mind, which all of a sudden has become a bad thing rather than a good thing. And so when I see the exploration of ideas in public, actually think that those are the people who are most open to the kind of vehement blowback as well. Right. Because that's part of what they're doing is that they're eliciting, hey, I'm gonna throw an idea into the arena. If it doesn't get attacked, they actually may be more nervous than if there is some level of, you know, kind of war of attrition if you will. And so what I've seen with a number of the people who have done this, everyone from, uh some of the best, you know, hedge fund managers and kind of money managers in the world all the way to what I'll consider some of the most uh intellectual people in the world they play with these ideas and they play with the ideas and they play with them and they play with them and they all arrive at the same conclusion and sometimes it takes a month, sometimes it takes years, but they arrive at this Bitcoin thesis. what's so interesting about it is it highlights something that many people view as a bug. But I think people in the Bitcoin community view as a feature, which is that community. so what ends up happening is when you have something that is as ambitious as a global reserve currency, doesn't mean it needs to unseat any of the existing ones but become the global reserve currency of the internet, right? This digital economy, you need shepherds of it. And so just like a technology company wants to find those loyal fans that are willing to go out and market and word of mouth and, and kind of not only uh promote it but also uh protect it. technology that is this decentralized thing, which uses a financial incentive in order to elicit the buy in uh not from a financial perspective, but from a mental energy standpoint has built one of the most rabid, powerful and engaged communities on the internet. And what ends up happening is those people have thought more about these ideas and actually challenged those ideas more than anyone else in the world. so I've got a lot of folks who will just say there's this guy Marty Bent who we'll talk all the time about Bitcoin critics haven't done their homework in a lot of cases. So they show up and sometimes it's super intellectual, lazy arguments, sometimes it's actually very well thought out arguments, you know, on, on the counter to the Bitcoin thesis. ultimately, what ends up happening is you're talking to somebody who's an expert, they've been thinking about this for 578, 10 years, right? They've gone through every simulation you possibly can and they show up with data examples. Um and responses now, they're not always right, but they've just done the work. And so what I actually uh like about folks like Eric and others is as they're kind of going through this journey, they're incredibly smart, right? And they provide, uh or, or they um apply a lot of intellectual rigor to some of these arguments. so what it does is what does it do? It's a marketplace, it keeps people honest."
