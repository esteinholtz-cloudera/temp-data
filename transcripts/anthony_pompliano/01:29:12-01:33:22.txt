  "Text": "used a different word that I think is kind of closer to your world, which is, it's ultimately automation. what I mean by that is uh you know, before 1970 or 1980 all the assets were analog. And so when you have analog assets, physical stock certificates, physical bonds, right? Physical de do a home, uh you have to physically exchange them when we wanted to increase and increase kind of global finance and access. We took those physical assets and we created electronic Q sip assets. So now we have in centralized databases, kind of a file represents the asset that's sitting somewhere in custody and you and I can transact them a little bit easier but still centralized. There's still some bureaucracy and, and uh you know, maybe it takes two days to transact rather than actually mailing it across the uh the world., what we're seeing is a transition from those electronic cuss to these digital assets. And so if you look at again, just let's say money or currency, every currency in the world is going to be digital, you're gonna have a digital dollar a digital euro yen RMB, you're gonna have decentralized, uh kind of open source uh money like Bitcoin, you're also gonna have private currencies like Facebook's attempt at DM. Uh and there will be others that will try to do this. so when you get everything digital, right? And I think that's the kind of the first step that everyone focuses on the competition at the technology layer essentially goes away. You get some level of feature parity and sure there's bells and whistles on each kind of implementation of a digital currency. But at the end of the day, the technology is relatively the same. Uh and ultimately, what it will do is it will facilitate the adoption of digital wallets. So you have to have a digital wallet regardless of what digital currency you have. Same with me, same with everybody else in the world. what it does do is when you kind of uh push away and reduce the friction of competition at the uh technology layer, it moves the competition to the monetary policy layer. And so when you get to that layer now, it becomes interesting because all of the currencies are the same except for this one right now and maybe there will be others in the future. Uh But, but for sure Bitcoin today and people may try to replicate in a private manner or something. But Bitcoin is kind of the the only finite scarce uh digital sum money and so you then have that pretty big difference in that competition at the monetary policy layer, it's actually not gonna matter where you get paid. Right. And, and what I mean by that is like you and I both live in a single currency environment. I get paid in dollars. I historically have saved in dollars. All of the assets in my life are denominated in dollars and I owe my debts in dollars, whether it's taxes or, or in the private market. I don't have to worry about foreign currencies. I don't exchange anything. The only time I would ever think about another currency is if I'm going to another country in their single currency environment and in order to change or exchange my currency, I go to the bank or I go get ripped off at the airport. Those are my two options. So it's high friction to change between currencies when the competition of technology is kind of um innovated away. I can get paid in dollars these digital dollars and with a click of a button switching to any other currency in the world. And so what ultimately happens is value and liquidity is going to coalesce around the best monetary policy. so you get in this very weird world where even if the United States says, hey, you're gonna get paid in dollars, you have to pay your taxes in dollars. You're gonna start to see people operate in a multi currency environment where they say ok, I got paid in my digital dollar click a button. I save in Bitcoin. It stays there. Protects or grows my purchasing power. Oh, I need to pay my taxes. Let me switch back into dollars with a click of a button and pay you go to a multi currency world, it's not just about currency, it's now multi asset world because not only is the currency digitized, but that same technology is used to digitize stocks, bonds and commodities as well. And so today, we live in a very fragmented financial world where basically I have a brokerage account. I have a bank account. I may have an alternative asset account, et cetera I can put all those assets in a single digital wallet and I can then go from asset to asset without having to go back to a single unit of account like"
