  "Text": ", and, and especially in light of the kind of the macro economy. Right. So, like what, what's so fascinating about the last 12 months is um in investing in general, the best returns trying to kind of put that in air quotes a little bit is something that is different than everything else. And right, so being different and wrong just means you're an idiot, right? Being different and right means that that's where kind of the outsized returns are. so if you look around the world at currencies today, they're all the same, they're all inflationary, unlimited supply controlled by a government done and uh decisions made in a very non transparent process. And what we've watched is the manipulation of all of those currencies over the last 12 months. direct contrast to that is this thing, Bitcoin, which is outside of the system has a finite supply, transparent and programmatic monetary policy. And so when you see those two systems kind of um in comparison to each other in the United States, there's a lot of people who say the dollar works great for me. I can go to the ATM, I can get out physical cash if I want to swipe a card I could do that. My money in my bank doesn't lose 50% of its value in a day in terms of purchasing power, like the dollar is pretty good you go to other countries, that might not be the case. And so I do think that there's a kind of a relative analysis that goes on here. If you compare Bitcoin to the dollar, there's all kinds of arguments to make that the dollar is better as a medium of exchange today. But if I go and I tell you what about in, you know, these kind of extreme examples of uh Venezuela, Zimbabwe Turkey, et cetera. And so I think that that's kind of one perspective to view this through is security versus all of the innovative components of a medium of exchange, et cetera. second thing though that I think is really, really important is around censorship. And so when you look at again, every currency in the world today, every single financial service, they're highly susceptible to censorship. And actually I would argue the United States is in the business of censorship in terms of, you know, how many countries around the world do we sanction and cut them off in either a minimal or a very material way from the global financial system.
