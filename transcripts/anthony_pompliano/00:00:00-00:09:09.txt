  "Text": "The following is a conversation with Anthony Polio entrepreneur, technology investor, prolific writer, podcaster and Twitter user on topics of finance, Cryptocurrency, technology and economics. I highly recommend his popular podcast and daily letter called The Pump podcast and the Pump Letter. Thank you to our sponsors their gun muscle recovery device, sun basket meal delivery service, Express VPN and indeed hiring website, click their links to support this podcast. a side note, let me say that I'll be having many conversations in the coming months about Cryptocurrency with people of all kinds of backgrounds and worldviews. Those who are proponents of Bitcoin, like Anthony Nick Carter, Robert Breedlove, Alex Glain and many others and those who are proponents of other Cryptocurrency technologies like Vitale Butin Charles Hoskinson, Richard, Hart Sergey Nazarov, Sylvia mcauley and many others as well. not framing this as a debate. I'm simply looking to explore exciting ideas in the space of technologies that could very well change human civilization and A G I civilization as well. appreciate that some communities are a bit more intense in their style of communication than others, but I personally am only interested in open minded respectful collaboration and exploring ideas. I personally try to like to approach conversations by considering that I may be wrong about everything. And I'm looking to learn, I won't engage in groupthink social signaling, outrage, mobs, mocking and derision. you do, I understand, it's just not my thing. I send you my love either way and hope to meet you in person or some drinks, some good laughs and a good conversation one day, no matter the difference in style or substance, we're all just human. After all, this is an amazing ride. We're all on together. Buy the ticket. Take the ride as Con S Thompson said, whether you pay for that ticket with Bitcoin Ethereum, dollar gold seashells, a beer or just a good old smile. usual, we have come to the part of the podcast where I do the ad reads.

It's surprisingly quiet, easy to use, comes with a great app that guides you through everything you need to know. There's been long stretches of my life where I would exercise quite a bit, especially when it was Jiu jitsu or uh grappling or wrestling or judo involved. There's many days where I would do two a days or three days, you know, training twice or three times a day basically every single day of the week. There was an art there to recovery, but also an art to the training process itself to avoid overtraining, but still pushing yourself to the limit. I very much from the school of Russian wrestling where drilling and exhausting the mind, not the body is the goal of training., try the gun for 30 days.

Like just a nice New York strip steak, trout, sea bass salmon and much more should mention here that one of my favorite activities is going fishing. love being one on one with nature for many hours at a time in that sort of peaceful Zen State where it's just you and the water. I'm mostly talking about freshwater fishing. I've actually never been deep sea fishing and I'm not exactly sure if I'm interested in that. It seems like a whole another world, but I sadly haven't done it regularly for a few years, but I'd like to get back into it. to nature regularly is a good mechanism for reminding me what's important in life..

It's a good tool to shift the asymmetry of power in the battle for free speech to the individual in the digital age. Your data, your private data is power and freedom is maintaining control over that data. There's a lot of tools that help with this. I think a VPN is just a very basic tool that all of us should be using for many of our interactions on the internet. technologies of course are just useful tools, useful hacks to get the job done. they can also have profound philosophical ideas behind them. I think the VPN is very much that the internet at its core is freedom, of course, that can be chaotic, that can even be dangerous, but ultimately freedom wins and the internet always wins in the end, go to Express vpn.com/lex pod to get an extra three months free. That's express vpn.com/lex pod for the simple, beautiful design of a big red button. else do you need in life? Friends? episode is also sponsored by indeed a hiring website. I've used them as part of many hiring efforts I've done for the teams. I've led. The main task is to quickly go from a huge number of initial applicants to a short list of great candidates. I recently had a discussion actually about the hiring process for engineers. And three things I've mentioned that I was looking for uh first is competence, extreme competence. So demonstrating they were able to dig into the details of a particular project that you worked on and demonstrate that there's both a skill and an obsession to getting every little detail right? And innovating in every single detail and questioning how that could be done better. second thing I look for is extreme passion. So just a love for first of all, everything in this world, but really a love for projects that you've done in the past, a love for projects that you might do in the future. And the third thing is diversity broadly, which is I love the weirdos. I love, I love people that don't quite fit in the square pegs if you will people that think differently in ways that are unlike my own. mean, this is where indeed comes in is you want to filter out the initial set of candidates to where you can really dedicate your energy, your attention to a few people at the very end to see who is actually a really, really good fit. I think that's a lot of work. But if it's done well, it's one of the most rewarding things you can do is to be in a team of people you love with whom you can create brilliant things., right now, get a free $75 credit at indeed.com/friedman. their best offer anywhere.
