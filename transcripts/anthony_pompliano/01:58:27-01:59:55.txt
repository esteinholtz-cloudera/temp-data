But, but here's the thing is the last 50 years or so is actually the outlier in history. people used to think this way, it's only when a fiat currency got introduced that one argument, the positive argument or, or perspective is there was an explosion in growth. really it's because there was a financial incentive to consume, right? And there's nobody better in the world than the United States at consuming and we consume anything and everything. And if you want to see a great example, look at how big the Coca Cola's are at mcdonald's right? You know, you go to other places, they don't serve them that big. And so the other example though, or the negative argument is we have to consume if not, you end up being the bottom 45% of Americans that held no investable assets and actually are just having their wealth devalued away. So holding the dollars end up being a very bad economic decision. so when you then switch to this sound money, you say, wait a second, why would I if today I can trade one Bitcoin, you know, back in October of last year, one Bitcoin for $10,000. Why would I spend that? If at some point in the future, whether it's a month from now or 10 years from now, I could trade it for something much, much more than that, just become much more of a um anti consumer and much more of a long term thinker."
