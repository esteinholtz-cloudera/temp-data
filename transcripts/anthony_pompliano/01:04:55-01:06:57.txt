  "Text": ", and, and if you start to pull on this a little bit and say, OK, a young person today, let's say somebody in their twenties has about 2 billion seconds left in their life, right? Kind of 60 years give or take um based on life expectancy, they usually until they start to understand this concept, think of wealth in dollar terms, dollars are being devalued. And so, you know, a million dollars doesn't get you what it used to get, right is kind of a, an old adage. And so what you're doing is you're pursuing something that ends up losing value. And so it's the constant rat race. It's how do I constantly try to get more, how do I get more dollars? How do I get more dollars? Because even if I say to myself, you know, I'm gonna retire when I get $100,000. When I get the $100,000 $100,000.05 years from now doesn't buy me what I thought it did. So now I need 500,000 or 200,000 or a million or whatever the number is. And so ultimately, what ends up occurring is that the Bitcoin community and many people in, in kind of this idea of sound money is you want to be able to acquire an asset that not only will hold the value, right, the store of value over time, but it will actually appreciate over time. so when you look at something like Bitcoin against the dollar against other types of assets, all of these assets are down compared to Bitcoin right now. Some of that's just in the early days of um kind of the pricing of an asset, you go from very small to something much larger. But now what you start to look at is, well, if you have a finite supply of something, what ends up happening is people begin to value it more. And so in a world where dollars are infinite and other fiat currencies are infinite. becomes very, very interesting, very special. Uh and something that is very aspirational. so I think that's where you're starting to see people say, wait a second, this is something where that finite secure store of value is essential to wealth generation and preservation over a long period of time."
