  "Text": "actually more interconnected than you're giving it credit for, right? Which is what is money, money is time ultimately,? The the pursuit of the acquisition of money, right? Of whether it's a currency or true money is because that should give you more time. And so one of my favorite movies ever is uh and it's funny because Justin Timberlake is in it. Uh is this movie lose most people at that part in in time. And basically the premise of the movie is that uh everyone has a clock that is embedded into their arm. And so, uh if you go to work, you basically put your arm underneath when you leave and there's time that's deposited into your clock. And if your clock ever hits all zeros, you're dead, you die on the spot. so there's a number of scenes where people are basically running, you know, to get to you and I give you a little bit more time so that you can get to work on Monday and then you work to acquire time. And so basically time becomes this currency. what becomes very fascinating about it is there are sections in society where literally there's physical places, if you only have, let's say 72 hours or less, you're allowed to go to section one, section five though is because you have years and years and years on your clock. And in this movie, everyone at the age of 25 freezes from a biological aging standpoint. So everyone stays the same, but you may have lived for 1000 years. so what becomes so fascinating about it is that rich people have time, poor people do not have time. And so in it, Justin Timberlake, the the main character at one point, uh essentially acquires a bunch of time and he's able to go to uh one of the higher levels. Um And now he's attending all these galas and you know, poker nights and all this stuff. And one of the first things that he learns is that in the lower end of society, everyone is running everywhere at all times in the movie time is so finite and it is so scarce. And so therefore, why would I walk down the street? I must run down the street the highest level of society. No one runs anywhere. And in fact, if you run, you are seen as lower class because wealth is time. And so that movie is, you know, it's got a ton of kind of um things that you can pull out of it. But to me is the perfect epitome of money is time. so when you start to think about the um acquisition of money, right, it goes to this whole idea of time billionaire. And I know that um there's probably a lot of people who have uh heard about this already, but if you think of a million seconds, it's about uh 11 days, billion seconds is 31 years. so if I said to somebody, you have to switch lives with Warren Buffett, would you do it? people would say sure, that'd be their initial reaction. I said, but you have to be, you know, 92 years old the money worth, the lack of time, most people would say no. Right. And there's this guy Graham Duncan, uh who really articulated this well, um and ultimately what ends up happening is you realize time is more valuable than the money, but you, you, you acquire the money to gain more time"
