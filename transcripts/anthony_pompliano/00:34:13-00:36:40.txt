  "Text": ", I would even take maximalism a step further. And it's not just the kind of singular viewpoint of this is the best, it's also an element of it's anti everything else,? So, you know, take keto, for example, uh the keto diet is not only the best diet, all the other diets are bad, right? And so it's, it's a very binary view of the world. Um I think that what's probably most misunderstood about uh let's take Bitcoin uh as a specific example is that most of the people who are labeled Bitcoin maximalist, would be open minded if they believed that something else came along, that was a superior technology or had a a better um kind of probability of achieving again, that ultimate vision, think where uh there's this controversy and kind of clashing of ideas is that the Bitcoin community believes Bitcoin is the best way to do that and has very specific arguments as to why the other things are not. Right. And so what ultimately ends up happening, which is very weird in uh the investing world, right? It's unlikely that you and I are going to sit down and you're gonna like apple stock is the best stock and there's no other stock that's worth anything, right? And, uh, and then all it's very weird if you said to me, um you know, this stock is worth zero and that's where everything that I own. I've put on a short on one single company, right? There's diversification, there's much more kind of probabilistic thinking in finance in general. Uh when it comes to this specific world of Cryptocurrency and kind of digital assets, if you will uh is there's two main groups of people who are trying to build two very, very different things at the onset. when you unpack it and you start to spend more and more time on it, you guys, they're actually trying to accomplish the same thing in two different ways. So Bitcoin is seen, I think as a uh a digital currency, right? Kind of the idea that this is going to ascend to become the next global reserve currency. It's a programmatic kind of transparent um money and uh it's essentially just 100 and 80 degrees difference than the inflationary, you know, non transparent uh fiat currencies that exist in the world, then look at kind of everything else, right? And you have a lot of smart contract platforms and various things that they're all going after an Ethereum with kind of the world computer approach. And you can kind of go down the line with all their other arguments to what they're trying to build. I think the big difference just comes down to uh innovation for security. when you simplistically look at it via that lens, you actually understand where both people are coming"
