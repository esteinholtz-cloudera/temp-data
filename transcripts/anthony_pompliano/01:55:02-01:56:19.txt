  "Text": "to other cultures. So if we remove ourselves from the western world culture of uh investing in Gamification of financial markets and in the financialization of everything, let's say we go to uh the culture of India for hundreds, if not thousands of years, families basically saved their wealth in gold and in jewelry and in these hard assets with the expectation pass it on to the next generation. And so it would be blasphemous to sell the family's gold in that culture, right? You know, your your great grandfather gave it to your grandfather, your grandfather gave it to your father, your father gave it to you, right? And so in that culture, the long term kind of uh holding is the default. think that what Bitcoin has presented again is a digital application of the exact same thing, which is that while everything else in the world is being devalued, that is denominated in a uh a currency that is being inflated away. Uh whether it's quickly or not this finite supply, this scarce asset ends up accruing more and more value over time. Right? so, um I think that for me personally, um I've got, you know, over 95% of my net worth that's in this"
