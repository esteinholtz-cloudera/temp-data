  "Text": "I think this is really, really important, right? Because you're right in that uh it's all about intention versus action. If your intention is to uh tell somebody that they are wrong in an effort to get them to see the truth that's very different than if your intention is to tell someone they're wrong and hurt their feelings, right? And, and so when you can unpack intention and action, you really quickly can tell what somebody ultimately is trying to accomplish. also think that one of the craziest things that I've seen play out is uh memes when I use that term, I'm not just talking about like a, a static photo, right? When I'm talking about these elaborate uh kind of edited videos and, and kind of all this stuff um done, right? is uh the most articulate way to deliver a blunt message and it's done in such a way that is humorous and entertaining really hammers the point home. And so a skill set that many people don't have. I don't make those. I'm, I'm assuming you don't make them either. Right? I see them. I share the ones that I like. Right? Uh But it does take practice and you can tell, look, there's people who are fantastic meme lords and there are people who absolutely suck at it and it's like anything. It's just good are you at communicating. And uh I've heard the idea a bunch of times so I don't know who to kind of credit for it, but uh whether it's emojis, it's gifts, it's memes, whatever this is the extension and evolution of just hieroglyphics,? Like, like we have been doing this for literally centuries. It's just that now we're doing it on the internet and you can press a button and go to millions and millions of people immediately."
