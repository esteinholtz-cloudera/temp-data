  "Text": "think a lot of artificial intelligence is uh in the name, simply the replication of human intelligence at scale, pro and pro uh programmatic meaning that the analog world, you could go hire 1000 employees or in, you know, in Amazon case, hire millions of employees set a mission or a goal and push them to go do that. That requires recruiting, training resources, all that stuff the virtual world or in, in this digital economy. What if you can just program the resources and gain the same leverage and do it at scale and do it in a very programmatic way and then have them actually make decisions in a way that doesn't require you to have thought of every single potential scenario or edge case. That's ultimately what we're talking about when we talk about artificial intelligence, right? And so when you look at that, technology is created, everyone uses it for good or bad, both get used, right? And so whether we're talking about cell phones, beepers, the internet, uh guns, whatever it's always used for good and bad, the big question is, and I think that, you know, yourself and many other people have rightfully said this is question really becomes, is the negative and nefarious uses of this inadvertent potentially? Or does it actually come from a malicious person? It's the intention malicious. And to me that's what II, I don't know enough, you know, much more about this and, and there's plenty of other people who do as well, but do think that there will be nefarious actors and malicious people, we're going to treat them the same way. We've always treated people who use technology poorly, right? We're gonna understand it. We're gonna identify it, we're gonna control it and then we're gonna end up reversing it or, or preventing them from doing that. It's the inadvertent things that I think are actually the most dangerous because when you have something that can think for itself there is no way to leverage a monopoly on violence for control. a very scary"
