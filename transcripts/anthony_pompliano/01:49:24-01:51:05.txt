  "Text": "so, um, if you kind of think of it as like the exchange software wallet, hardware wallet. And then there's something called deep storage, right? Or cold storage. Um, and this is, you know, literally there was a, a company called Zapp O that, uh would put things in deep cold storage and it was literally buried in a mountain,? So, like the odds that somebody's physically gonna go there, there's armed guards, there's, you know, kind of all this type of stuff. Uh, but again, you're taking some level of counter party risk because they have your Bitcoin. And so the saying or the phrase uh is not your keys, not your coins. Uh Whereas uh my buddy Isaiah Jackson came up with, he said, uh uh not your keys, not your cheese, right? In terms of uh uh sovereignty is important, right? And ultimately, this goes back to kind of the beginning of our conversation around Bitcoins, ethos,, right? Giving the power back to people. You don't have to rely on uh this infrastructure in order to be able to participate in this monetary uh kind of economy which you are now able to do is you're able to use digital sound money, you're able to keep control of it. You and you alone are responsible for it. So the idea of personal responsibility, um and then also you and you alone make the decisions as to whether you hold on to it or you use it without censorship, right? No one can tell you what you can do with it or can't do with it. And so purchase and the storage, um, what I find is uh depending on who you are, there's varying uh degrees of uh kind of concern or decisions that get made there. And a lot of it comes down to personal preference. Bitcoin community though absolutely will over optimize for sovereignty and kind of hardware or cold storage."
