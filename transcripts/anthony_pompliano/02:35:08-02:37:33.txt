  "Text": ", I like uh bezos' view, which is uh is essentially how do you minimize regret? How do you accelerate your life mentally and go to 80 90 100 100 and 50 years, whatever we end up uh being, you know, fortunate enough to live to and then look backwards and say this decision that I'm gonna make, have two options, which one is going to be the one that I least regret. if you continue to make decisions that way, one, you have that long term view kind of built in because you're working backwards. Uh two, you are ultimately going to optimize for uh minimal regret. But also three is even if you only look for 10 years, much, much further than most people do. And so it gives you a significant advantage and I think that um Bitcoin has kind of this like, um you know, proxy for time as we talked about uh inter planetary travel where there's multiple steps from creating a reusable rocket to landing it to, you know, all this stuff the way to simple things. Just like you're simply trying to figure out where the world's gonna be 30 years from now, know, Bill Gates says that we overestimate what we can do in one year, underestimate what we can do in 10., to me, it's a um kind of degree of uh mistake. If you will 10 years, maybe you're off by 10%. Well, if that line of progress continues, 20 years, you may be off by 100% and 30 years, you may be off by 1000% right? But like almost the further you go out, the more inaccurate you become. so I think that people who want to iterate their way to success, right? There's a common thing in like the start up world up actually following kind of the bread crumbs to where the world is taking them. But people like an Elon Musk, a Jeff Bezos, a Jack Dorsey all the way down the line. All these innovators, actually say to themselves, there is a point in time in the future where there's a world I want to construct and then they go and they construct it regardless of the short term iterations and incentives. It is just they're driving towards that point. And I think that it's this whole idea of having this, like, you know, kind of set vision and this uh refusal to kind of move or budge off of that, that's what makes them special."
